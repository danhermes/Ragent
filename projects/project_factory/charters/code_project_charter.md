---

## Task

1. Define project scope clearly:
   - **In Scope:** Development of the Project Factory system with integration capabilities, real-time dashboards, and support for multiple concurrent projects.
   - **Out of Scope:** Development of new agent systems or workflows not directly related to Project Factory.

2. Identify target users or stakeholders.

3. Highlight known constraints:
   - **Budget:** Limited spending on third-party software.
   - **Tools:** Limited compatibility with non-standard systems.
   - **Political/Ethical:** Compliance with data handling guidelines.

4. List initial risks and external dependencies:
   - Lack of integration support from third-party tools.
   - Potential delays due to resource unavailability.
   - System failures or downtime affecting existing workflows.

5. Add `[TODO]` markers for any unresolved items—these will be expanded in future meetings.

## Risks
- **Technical Risks:** Potential integration challenges with existing systems.
- **Operational Risks:** Resistance to adoption by non-technical stakeholders.
- **External Dependencies:** Reliance on third-party tools and agents (e.g., n8n, GitHub).

[TODO] Define project phases in more detail.
