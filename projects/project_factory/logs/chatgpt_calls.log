**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Owner:** [Insert Owner]

---

## Introduction
The objective of this document is to provide a detailed technical implementation plan for the Project Factory system which automates project planning and execution with real-time monitoring capabilities and minimal human intervention.

---

## Module Overview

### 1. AI Director (Blane)

**Purpose:**  
To serve as the intelligent core that plans, monitors, and adjusts project workflows autonomously.

**Classes and Interfaces:**

- `Blane`: The main AI class responsible for high-level project management.
- `PlanGenerator`: Generates project plans and updates.

```python
class Blane:
    def __init__(self, project_data: dict):
        ...

    def generate_plan(self) -> str:
        """Generate a project plan based on input data."""
        ...

    def monitor_project(self) -> None:
        """Monitor ongoing project status."""
        ...

    def adjust_plan(self, issue_id: int) -> None:
        """Adjust the project plan based on identified issues."""
        ...
```

- **Runtime Considerations:**  
  Validate input data, handle intermittent data failures, set up auto-retry and circuit breaker mechanisms.

### 2. Real-time Dashboard

**Purpose:**  
To provide stakeholders with continuous visibility of project status and metrics.

**Classes and Interfaces:**

- `Dashboard`: The interface displaying real-time project data.
- `DataAggregator`: Gathers data for display.

```python
class Dashboard:
    def update_display(self) -> None:
        """Refresh the dashboard with the latest data."""
        ...

    def alert_stakeholders(self, issue_log: list) -> None:
        """Notify stakeholders of significant project issues."""
        ...
```

- **Runtime Considerations:**  
  Ensure data streams are resilient, incorporate failover mechanisms, and provide low-latency updates.

---

## Phase-to-Component Mapping

### Phases:
- **Plan:** Utilizes `Blane` and `PlanGenerator` to establish a comprehensive project plan.
  - Components: AI Director, Plan Generator

- **Schedule:** Utilizes timeline modules for scheduling with automated reminders and alerts.
  - Components: TaskScheduler

- **Execute and Project Work:** Driven primarily by worker and sub-system modules coordinating various tasks.
  - Components: TaskExecutor, ResourceAllocator

- **Standup:** AI Director manages standup reports through data from `Dashboard` and updates using cross-module communication.
  - Components: Dashboard, Blane

- **Dashboard:** Involves all components to ensure real-time updates.
  - Components: All data interfacing modules

---

## Integration Specifications

- **API Contract:** A RESTful API with endpoints for plan retrieval (`GET /plans`), data submission (`POST /data`), and status updates (`PATCH /status`).

- **Authentication/Authorization:** Utilize OAuth 2.0 for secure access.

- **Error Handling Protocols:** Implement retry logic for REST calls, employ dead letter queues for failed messages, and maintain consistent state throughout distributed transactions.

---

## Implementation Details
### Method Signature Examples:

```python
def generate_plan(self) -> str:
    """
    Generate a project plan.

    Returns:
        str: The formatted project plan.
    """
    # logic to synthesize plan
    ...

def update_dashboard(self, data_payload: dict) -> None:
    """
    Update the real-time dashboard.
    
    Parameters:
        data_payload (dict): Real-time data metrics for update.
    """
    # logic to refresh dashboard
    ...
```

- **State Transitions:** Employ versioning for data models to ensure backward compatibility.

---

## Security Model

- **Data Protection:** Encrypt all data at rest and in transit using AES-256 and TLS 1.2/1.3.

- **Audit Logging:** Record all access and modifications to sensitive project data, ensuring traceability.

- **Threat Modeling:** Regularly update the threat model to include new vulnerabilities identified through routine penetration testing and audits.

---

## Deliverable Validation

- **[TODO] Completion:** All placeholder code must be replaced with actual implementations. Ensure test hooks are clearly defined, and that outputs conform with established schemas and formats.

---

The above sections form the basis of your 15-20 page technical document. Provide detailed structural diagrams, pseudocode, and full method implementations. Ensure each section has actionable steps and clear definitions of deliverables.

## Document Review: "Technical Design – Code Project"

### Completeness Check

1. **Modules & Sections**
   - Ensure entries such as **Module Name** and **Purpose** are complete and give a clear understanding of the module's intent. None should be left blank or as `[TODO]`.

2. **Core Logic & Flow**
   - Confirm detailed descriptions for each submodule or class like `MainProcessor`, `DataLoader`, and `ErrorHandler`. `[TODO]` tags should be converted to actionable text.

3. **Interface & Dependency Specifications**
   - Verify comprehensive outlines for all interfaces, including interactions like API calls and shared data formats.

4. **Testing Plan**
   - All testing strategies (unit and integration) must be explicitly described with no high-level placeholders remaining.

### Depth Check

1. **Method Signatures & Logic**
   - Each module should have defined method signatures and detail associated logic per method. Expand abbreviated logic descriptions into full prose.

2. **Input/Output Definitions**
   - Every input and output for methods needs a detailed frame (data types, format requirements, etc.). Make sure these sections aren't vague.

### Clarity & Consistency

1. **Terminology & Formatting**
   - Check for technical terms that are used incorrectly or inconsistently. Ensure terminology aligns across all documents and disciplines (e.g., `n8n` workflows).

2. **Redundancy**
   - Look out for repeated content or duplication of details across sections (for instance, project goals rehashed in technical specifications).

### Final Readiness

1. **Developer Hand-off Readiness**
   - Determine whether the specification can be implemented directly by a developer, or if further clarification is needed. Identify any unaddressed questions.

### Consistency Verification

1. **Component Names & Usage**
   - Align component names throughout the entire set of project documents. Inconsistencies can cause implementation missteps or confusion during integration.

2. **Files & Directory Structure**
   - Ensure a consistent directory structure and naming conventions for files as mentioned in both design and project implementation scopes.

3. **Interfaces & Links**
   - Confirm complete specifications and consistent naming of interfaces as outlined in the project goals and design documents.

4. **Goal Alignment**
   - All original project specifications should correlate directly to documented technical design elements. Any missing components should be identified and noted.

### Deliverable Validation

1. **[TODO] Items**
   - Thoroughly list requirements and information needed to replace `[TODO]` markers with substantive text.

2. **Implementation Code**
   - All placeholder code snippets need actual implementation conversions to reflect what will be built.

3. **Concrete Specifications**
   - Transform high-level concepts into precise requirements with clear, testable objectives and criteria.

4. **Examples & Verifications**
   - Provide working examples for all stated interfaces, API calls, file formats, etc., and ensure that all deliverable items have set definitions for completion.

### Final Summary:

#### Approved Sections:
- [List of Sections]

#### Needs Refinement:
- [List of Sections]

#### Incomplete:
- [List of Sections]

No section should be ignored, ensuring a fully comprehensive review preparing the document for the next development phase. Each aspect must meet quality standards for technical design readiness, ensuring minimal ambiguity and full executable clarity for developers.
