- **Feedback Loop:** Real-time Outputs -> Communication Hub -> Stakeholder Inputs

### Known Constraints
- Integration complexities with third-party APIs.
- Resource limitations (compute, storage).
- Compliance with corporate data-handling policies.

---

## Handoff Notes to Implementation

- **Module Implementation:** Each module should be implemented as independent classes or callable modules following a modular architecture pattern.
- **Interface Design:** Use consistent naming conventions and typing. CLI interactions should leverage `argparse`.
- **Placeholders:** Mark stub or placeholder methods with `[TODO]` and provide detailed comments on the expected behavior.
- **Testing:** Develop unit test stubs with an emphasis on edge cases.
- **Documentation:** Ensure all inputs and outputs are properly typed and documented.

    :param directive: High-level project directive.
    :return: Structured project plan.
    """
    # TODO: Implement directive translation logic.
    return structured_plan

def manage_dashboard(data):
    """
    Manage and update the real-time dashboard.
    :param data: Data for dashboard update.
    :return: Success or failure status.
    """
    # TODO: Implement dashboard management logic.
    return status
```

## Project Overview

### System Name
**AI-Powered Project Factory System (Blane)**

### Project Purpose
Blane is designed to automate the conversion of high-level project directives into structured, executable project plans, thereby facilitating efficient project execution, real-time monitoring, and lifecycle management. The system aims to improve transparency, efficiency, and minimize human intervention during project management processes.

### Business Objectives
- Automate project management to enhance efficiency and scalability.
- Provide real-time project visibility for stakeholders through dashboards.
- Support multiple concurrent projects with minimal manual intervention.
- Integrate smoothly with existing workflows, including n8n and RAgent systems.

---

## Functional Overview

### General Description
Blane is an AI-driven system that orchestrates the entire development lifecycle for project management. It breaks down high-level directives into actionable plans, automates workflows, manages status dashboards, and handles error conditions with the potential for human intervention when necessary.

### Core Functions
- **Goal Translation**: Converts strategic directives into structured project plans.
- **Workflow Automation**: Activates and manages workflows with minimal human intervention.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Updates stakeholders through dashboards on project status and progress.
- **Lifecycle Orchestration**: Manages phases from planning to execution and reviews.

---

## System Architecture

### System Overview
The system includes modular components that interact via defined APIs and file exchanges. It integrates with external systems like n8n and GitHub, and enables real-time dashboard updates through JSON APIs.

### Component Breakdown

| Module          | Role                                                   |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Goal Translator | Converts strategic objectives into `.goal.yaml` files. |
| Workflow Engine | Automates workflow activation via `.workflow.json`.    |
| Dashboard      | Displays real-time status with `.dashboard.json`.       |
| ErrorHandler   | Manages system errors and escalations.                  |

# Technical Implementation Document

**Project: Project Factory System with AI Director (Blane)**

**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Owner:** [Insert Owner]

---

## Introduction
The objective of this document is to provide a detailed technical implementation plan for the Project Factory system which automates project planning and execution with real-time monitoring capabilities and minimal human intervention.

---

## Module Overview

### 1. AI Director (Blane)

**Purpose:**  
To serve as the intelligent core that plans, monitors, and adjusts project workflows autonomously.

**Classes and Interfaces:**

- `Blane`: The main AI class responsible for high-level project management.
- `PlanGenerator`: Generates project plans and updates.

```python
class Blane:
    def __init__(self, project_data: dict):
        ...

    def generate_plan(self) -> str:
        """Generate a project plan based on input data."""
        ...

    def monitor_project(self) -> None:
        """Monitor ongoing project status."""
        ...

    def adjust_plan(self, issue_id: int) -> None:
        """Adjust the project plan based on identified issues."""
        ...
```

- **Runtime Considerations:**  
  Validate input data, handle intermittent data failures, set up auto-retry and circuit breaker mechanisms.

### 2. Real-time Dashboard

**Purpose:**  
To provide stakeholders with continuous visibility of project status and metrics.

**Classes and Interfaces:**

- `Dashboard`: The interface displaying real-time project data.
- `DataAggregator`: Gathers data for display.

```python
class Dashboard:
    def update_display(self) -> None:
        """Refresh the dashboard with the latest data."""
        ...

    def alert_stakeholders(self, issue_log: list) -> None:
        """Notify stakeholders of significant project issues."""
        ...
```

- **Runtime Considerations:**  
  Ensure data streams are resilient, incorporate failover mechanisms, and provide low-latency updates.

---

## Phase-to-Component Mapping

### Phases:
- **Plan:** Utilizes `Blane` and `PlanGenerator` to establish a comprehensive project plan.
  - Components: AI Director, Plan Generator

- **Schedule:** Utilizes timeline modules for scheduling with automated reminders and alerts.
  - Components: TaskScheduler

- **Execute and Project Work:** Driven primarily by worker and sub-system modules coordinating various tasks.
  - Components: TaskExecutor, ResourceAllocator

- **Standup:** AI Director manages standup reports through data from `Dashboard` and updates using cross-module communication.
  - Components: Dashboard, Blane

- **Dashboard:** Involves all components to ensure real-time updates.
  - Components: All data interfacing modules

---

## Integration Specifications

- **API Contract:** A RESTful API with endpoints for plan retrieval (`GET /plans`), data submission (`POST /data`), and status updates (`PATCH /status`).

- **Authentication/Authorization:** Utilize OAuth 2.0 for secure access.

- **Error Handling Protocols:** Implement retry logic for REST calls, employ dead letter queues for failed messages, and maintain consistent state throughout distributed transactions.

---

## Implementation Details
### Method Signature Examples:

```python
def generate_plan(self) -> str:
    """
    Generate a project plan.

    Returns:
        str: The formatted project plan.
    """
    # logic to synthesize plan
    ...

def update_dashboard(self, data_payload: dict) -> None:
    """
    Update the real-time dashboard.
    
    Parameters:
        data_payload (dict): Real-time data metrics for update.
    """
    # logic to refresh dashboard
    ...
```

- **State Transitions:** Employ versioning for data models to ensure backward compatibility.

---

## Security Model

- **Data Protection:** Encrypt all data at rest and in transit using AES-256 and TLS 1.2/1.3.

- **Audit Logging:** Record all access and modifications to sensitive project data, ensuring traceability.

- **Threat Modeling:** Regularly update the threat model to include new vulnerabilities identified through routine penetration testing and audits.

---

## Deliverable Validation

- **[TODO] Completion:** All placeholder code must be replaced with actual implementations. Ensure test hooks are clearly defined, and that outputs conform with established schemas and formats.

---

The above sections form the basis of your 15-20 page technical document. Provide detailed structural diagrams, pseudocode, and full method implementations. Ensure each section has actionable steps and clear definitions of deliverables.

   - Each module should have defined method signatures and detail associated logic per method. Expand abbreviated logic descriptions into full prose.

2. **Input/Output Definitions**
   - Every input and output for methods needs a detailed frame (data types, format requirements, etc.). Make sure these sections aren't vague.

### Clarity & Consistency

1. **Terminology & Formatting**
   - Check for technical terms that are used incorrectly or inconsistently. Ensure terminology aligns across all documents and disciplines (e.g., `n8n` workflows).

2. **Redundancy**
   - Look out for repeated content or duplication of details across sections (for instance, project goals rehashed in technical specifications).

### Final Readiness

1. **Developer Hand-off Readiness**
   - Determine whether the specification can be implemented directly by a developer, or if further clarification is needed. Identify any unaddressed questions.

### Consistency Verification

1. **Component Names & Usage**
   - Align component names throughout the entire set of project documents. Inconsistencies can cause implementation missteps or confusion during integration.

2. **Files & Directory Structure**
   - Ensure a consistent directory structure and naming conventions for files as mentioned in both design and project implementation scopes.

3. **Interfaces & Links**
   - Confirm complete specifications and consistent naming of interfaces as outlined in the project goals and design documents.

4. **Goal Alignment**
   - All original project specifications should correlate directly to documented technical design elements. Any missing components should be identified and noted.

### Deliverable Validation

1. **[TODO] Items**
   - Thoroughly list requirements and information needed to replace `[TODO]` markers with substantive text.

2. **Implementation Code**
   - All placeholder code snippets need actual implementation conversions to reflect what will be built.

3. **Concrete Specifications**
   - Transform high-level concepts into precise requirements with clear, testable objectives and criteria.

4. **Examples & Verifications**
   - Provide working examples for all stated interfaces, API calls, file formats, etc., and ensure that all deliverable items have set definitions for completion.

No section should be ignored, ensuring a fully comprehensive review preparing the document for the next development phase. Each aspect must meet quality standards for technical design readiness, ensuring minimal ambiguity and full executable clarity for developers.----Next response: To ensure that the technical specification is complete and ready for implementation, let’s break down each task, focusing on the key areas mentioned within the document:

### 1. Completeness Check
- **Sections Presence**: Ensure every section listed in the technical specification is present and detailed. This includes titles such as “Module Name,” “Inputs,” “Outputs,” “Core Logic/Structure,” and others, each meaningfully filled out.
  - **[TODO] Notation**: Review any placeholders or `TODO` items. Specify what exact details are missing. For instance, clarify whether it’s additional code snippets, more detailed descriptions of dependencies, or clarifications on testing plans, and propose specific means to address these.

### 2. Depth Check
- **Method Definitions**: Verify every module is clearly defined with method signatures, internal logic, and expected behavior. Inputs and outputs should be described for each sub-component or function, ensuring no ambiguity on what data it accepts or outputs.
- **Detailed Processes**: Examine that each process, API, or interaction listed provides a full breakdown, especially around error handling and data flow.

### 3. Clarity & Consistency
- **Terminology and Formatting**: Identify unclear language or terminology that could cause misunderstandings during implementation. Ensure consistent use of terms and language style throughout the document.
- **Redundancy**: Mark any repetitious or duplicative content, particularly if sections from prior meetings are repeated without contributing new information.

### 4. Final Readiness
- **Development Readiness**: Assess if the specification is sufficiently detailed to proceed to the coding phase. If gaps or ambiguities are discovered, recommend another review cycle.
  
### 5. Consistency Verification
- **Component Naming**: Confirm that every component name used matches across documentation.
- **Paths and Directories**: Ensure that file paths and directory structures remain consistent and match those referenced in the design documentation.
- **Document Cross-Referencing**: Verify that interfaces mentioned are fully fleshed out in appropriate sections across related documents.
- **Terminology Uniformity**: Ensure terms remain the same throughout the technical documents to avoid confusion.

### 6. Deliverable Validation
- **Specificity in Completion**: Address `[TODO]` items by specifying the required data or decisions to resolve them, like precise configurations or detailed examples.
- **Concrete Implementation**: Replace any placeholder codes with actionable, real code snippets or commands. Descriptions should evolve from abstract to concrete, providing measurable outcomes.
- **Clear Definitions of Done**: Each checklist item needs an explicit "definition of done," accompanied by steps for verification or testing.
- **Example Provision**: Ensure every reference to a file format, API, or interface includes tangible examples, giving developers concrete data to work from.

### Comments and Feedback
Per-section commentary should be thorough, covering the specific points where improvements, additional details, or corrections are needed. This includes:

- **Approved**: Sections fully fleshed out, accurate, and not requiring further edits.
- **Needs Refinement**: Parts requiring slight adjustments for clarity, consistency, or depth.
- **Incomplete**: Areas with missing information that are critical and must be completed before approval.

### Summary
- Include a concise summary of the overall state of the specification, the readiness to move to development, and any overarching issues that need attention.
- Highlight the expected outcomes once suggestions are implemented, offering a path to final approval and execution.

Such a structured approach ensures that the project can proceed with confidence, minimizing misunderstandings and maximizing efficiency during the development and deployment phases.

No section should be ignored, ensuring a fully comprehensive review preparing the document for the next development phase. Each aspect must meet quality standards for technical design readiness, ensuring minimal ambiguity and full executable clarity for developers.----Next response: To ensure that the technical specification is complete and ready for implementation, let’s break down each task, focusing on the key areas mentioned within the document:

### 1. Completeness Check
- **Sections Presence**: Ensure every section listed in the technical specification is present and detailed. This includes titles such as “Module Name,” “Inputs,” “Outputs,” “Core Logic/Structure,” and others, each meaningfully filled out.
  - **[TODO] Notation**: Review any placeholders or `TODO` items. Specify what exact details are missing. For instance, clarify whether it’s additional code snippets, more detailed descriptions of dependencies, or clarifications on testing plans, and propose specific means to address these.

### 2. Depth Check
- **Method Definitions**: Verify every module is clearly defined with method signatures, internal logic, and expected behavior. Inputs and outputs should be described for each sub-component or function, ensuring no ambiguity on what data it accepts or outputs.
- **Detailed Processes**: Examine that each process, API, or interaction listed provides a full breakdown, especially around error handling and data flow.

### 3. Clarity & Consistency
- **Terminology and Formatting**: Identify unclear language or terminology that could cause misunderstandings during implementation. Ensure consistent use of terms and language style throughout the document.
- **Redundancy**: Mark any repetitious or duplicative content, particularly if sections from prior meetings are repeated without contributing new information.

### 4. Final Readiness
- **Development Readiness**: Assess if the specification is sufficiently detailed to proceed to the coding phase. If gaps or ambiguities are discovered, recommend another review cycle.
  
### 5. Consistency Verification
- **Component Naming**: Confirm that every component name used matches across documentation.
- **Paths and Directories**: Ensure that file paths and directory structures remain consistent and match those referenced in the design documentation.
- **Document Cross-Referencing**: Verify that interfaces mentioned are fully fleshed out in appropriate sections across related documents.
- **Terminology Uniformity**: Ensure terms remain the same throughout the technical documents to avoid confusion.

### 6. Deliverable Validation
- **Specificity in Completion**: Address `[TODO]` items by specifying the required data or decisions to resolve them, like precise configurations or detailed examples.
- **Concrete Implementation**: Replace any placeholder codes with actionable, real code snippets or commands. Descriptions should evolve from abstract to concrete, providing measurable outcomes.
- **Clear Definitions of Done**: Each checklist item needs an explicit "definition of done," accompanied by steps for verification or testing.
- **Example Provision**: Ensure every reference to a file format, API, or interface includes tangible examples, giving developers concrete data to work from.

### Comments and Feedback
Per-section commentary should be thorough, covering the specific points where improvements, additional details, or corrections are needed. This includes:

- **Approved**: Sections fully fleshed out, accurate, and not requiring further edits.
- **Needs Refinement**: Parts requiring slight adjustments for clarity, consistency, or depth.
- **Incomplete**: Areas with missing information that are critical and must be completed before approval.

### Summary
- Include a concise summary of the overall state of the specification, the readiness to move to development, and any overarching issues that need attention.
- Highlight the expected outcomes once suggestions are implemented, offering a path to final approval and execution.

Such a structured approach ensures that the project can proceed with confidence, minimizing misunderstandings and maximizing efficiency during the development and deployment phases.

## Inputs

- **Data Formats:** YAML, JSON, MD
- **Sources:** User inputs, existing system data, third-party API responses. Specify expected input formats and include examples of files or API calls to guide the implementation effectively.

---

## Outputs

- **File Formats:** `.goal.yaml`, `.project_plan.yaml`, `.dashboard.json`
- **Destinations:** Internal dashboards, stakeholder communication platforms. Detail the expected output formats and include examples to provide clarity on what constitutes successful processing.

---

## Interfaces & Dependencies

- REST APIs connect the Dashboard with external systems.
- Compatible with project management tools using JSON-based I/O protocols.
- Dependencies include third-party systems like n8n for workflow automation. Ensure that all dependencies are exhaustively noted, including external libraries, and provide diagrams or flowcharts to illustrate interactions.

---

## Core Logic / Structure

### Submodules or Classes

- **AI Office Director (Blane):** Oversees execution and aligns with strategic goals.
- **Goal Translator:** Converts high-level directives into structured project plans.
- **Workflow Engine (AutoCoder):** Manages the logic of task flows and dependencies.
- **Integration Handlers:** Connect existing agent systems and workflows like RAgent and n8n seamlessly.
- **Error Management Module:** Monitors and recovers from system anomalies.

### Internal Flow

- Directives in `.goal.yaml` initiate the Goal Translator to create project plans.
- Plans trigger workflows managed by the Workflow Engine.
- Real-time data from these workflows is visualized in the Dashboard.
- The ErrorHandler preemptively manages and corrects system issues. Provide a detailed flowchart or pseudocode to illustrate the main execution path, describing the control flow between components.

---

## Testing Plan

### Approach

- **Unit Tests:** Cover functionality within individual modules with a focus on branch coverage.
- **Integration Tests:** Validate the interactions between modules and the execution of workflows.
- **Edge Cases:** Ensure the robustness of handling atypical inputs and system states. Include additional tests relevant to specific requirements and ensure comprehensiveness by detailing specific testing methodologies and expected outcomes.

### Key Scenarios

- Real-time dashboard updates under various data conditions.
- Seamless flow from directive input to task execution.
- System's ability to recover from simulated failure conditions.

## Code Snippets

- **Main Loop or Entrypoint:** 
  ```python
  def main():
      load_initial_configs()
      start_goal_translation_process()
  ```

- **CLI parser / interface example:**
  ```python
  import argparse

  def parse_cli():
      parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Project Factory CLI')
      parser.add_argument('--goal-input', type=str, required=True, help='Path to the goal YAML file')
      args = parser.parse_args()
      return args
  ```

- **Complex Algorithmic Logic:**
  ```python
  def translate_goals_to_tasks(goal_input):
      # logic to convert high-level goals to task objects
      return task_list
  ```

- **Error Handling:**
  ```python
  try:
      execute_workflow()
  except Exception as e:
      error_handler.recover(e)
  ```

Add fully-fledged examples for at least one main function per section. Each snippet should be well-commented to provide clarity on purpose and logic.

## Document Review: "Technical Design – Code Project"

### Completeness Check

1. **Modules & Sections**
   - Approved: Ensure entries such as **Module Name** and **Purpose** are complete and provide a clear understanding of the module's intent. None should be left blank or as `[TODO]`. Specify what exact details are missing for any `[TODO]` items.

2. **Core Logic & Flow**
   - Needs refinement: Confirm detailed descriptions for each submodule or class like `MainProcessor`, `DataLoader`, and `ErrorHandler`. Convert `[TODO]` tags into actionable text.

3. **Interface & Dependency Specifications**
   - Incomplete: Make sure comprehensive outlines for all interfaces, including interactions like API calls and shared data formats, are present. Ensure that all dependencies are noted.

### Depth Check

1. **Method Signatures & Logic**
   - Needs refinement: Each module should have defined method signatures and detail associated logic per method. Expand abbreviated logic descriptions into full prose.

2. **Input/Output Definitions**
   - Needs refinement: Every input and output for methods needs a detailed frame (data types, format requirements, etc.) Make sure these sections aren't vague. Include examples of files, data formats, or API calls if available.

### Clarity & Consistency

1. **Terminology & Formatting**
   - Needs refinement: Check for technical terms that are used incorrectly or inconsistently. Ensure terminology aligns across all documents and disciplines (e.g., `n8n` workflows).

2. **Redundancy**
   - Needs refinement: Look out for repetitive content or duplication of details across sections (for instance, project goals rehashed in technical specifications).

### Final Readiness

1. **Developer Hand-off Readiness**
   - Needs refinement: Determine whether the specification can be implemented directly by a developer, or if further clarification is needed. Identify any unaddressed questions.

### Consistency Verification

1. **Component Names & Usage**
   - Needs refinement: Align component names throughout the entire set of project documents. Inconsistencies can cause implementation missteps or confusion during integration.

2. **Files & Directory Structure**
   - Needs refinement: Ensure a consistent directory structure and naming conventions for files as mentioned in both design and project implementation scopes.

3. **Interfaces & Links**
   - Incomplete: Confirm complete specifications and consistent naming of interfaces as outlined in the project goals and design documents.

### Deliverable Validation

1. **[TODO] Items**
   - Needs refinement: Thoroughly list requirements and information needed to replace `[TODO]` markers with substantive text.

2. **Implementation Code**
   - Needs refinement: All placeholder code snippets need actual implementation conversions to reflect what will be built.

### Final Summary:

#### Completeness Check:
- **Approved Sections:** Purpose, Security / Permissions
- **Needs Refinement:** Functional Overview, Inputs, Outputs, Core Logic / Structure
- **Incomplete:** Interfaces & Dependencies, Files & Directories, Code Snippets

No section should be ignored, ensuring a fully comprehensive review preparing the document for the next development phase. Each aspect must meet quality standards for technical design readiness, ensuring minimal ambiguity and full executable clarity for developers.
