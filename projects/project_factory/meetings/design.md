#### 2. **Project Planning Module**
   - **Role:** Develop detailed project plans from parsed tasks.
   - **Inputs:** Tasks from Directive Processing Module.
   - **Outputs:** Stratified project plans with milestones.
   - **External APIs:** RAgent for resource allocation and timeline checking.

#### 3. **Execution Orchestration Module**
   - **Role:** Automate execution of the project plan.
   - **Inputs:** Project plan data.
   - **Outputs:** Real-time status updates.
   - **External APIs:** Trigger task-level workflows via n8n.

#### 4. **Dashboard Module**
   - **Role:** Provide real-time visibility into project status.
   - **Inputs:** Status updates from Execution Orchestration Module.
   - **Outputs:** Visualized data for stakeholders.
   - **External APIs:** Visualization tools and data aggregation services.

#### 5. **Integration Module**

### Data Flow and Control Logic
1. Directives are input into the Directive Processing Module, analyzing and translating them into project tasks.
2. Project Planning Module refines tasks into a cohesive project plan with resource checks via RAgent.
3. Execution Orchestration Module automates tasks, updates status in real-time, feeds into the Dashboard Module.
4. Integration Module ensures smooth data flow between the AI system and n8n/RAgent workflows.
5. Feedback and errors route through the Stakeholder Feedback and Error Recovery Modules respectively, ensuring continuous improvement and system resilience.

### Known Constraints

## System Architecture

### System Overview
The AI-powered Project Management System will be a comprehensive platform designed to automate the project lifecycle from initiation to completion. The system is intended to enhance visibility and efficiency in project management through AI-driven decision-making and workflow execution.

### Component Breakdown
The architecture will be divided into several key modules, each responsible for a specific set of functionalities:

| Module          | Role                                                                                                |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Directive Parser| Interprets high-level directives into structured project plans.                                      |
| Workflow Engine | Manages and executes workflows, activates agents as needed.                                          |
| Dashboard       | Provides real-time visibility into project status and progress.                                      |
