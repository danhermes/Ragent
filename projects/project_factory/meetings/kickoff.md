# Project Kickoff Notes

## 1. Confirm Project Scope
### Scope Validation
- **Goals**: The project goals are clearly outlined, focusing on the development of the AI-Powered Project Management System with Blane as the AI-powered Office Director, integration with existing systems, and enhancing project visibility.
- **In Scope**: The scope includes developing the AI management system, integrating workflows, and implementing dashboards.
- **Out of Scope**: Developing new organizational processes outside project management needs is explicitly out of scope.

### Ambiguities/Unprioritized/Missing:
- **Goal Specification**: While goals are well defined, prioritisations within those goals are not clearly noted. Additional prioritisation can help clarify which elements are critical to the projectâ€™s success.
- **Missing Details**: Precise dates for checkpoints, reviews, and final deliverables are unspecified under the timelines. It's imperative to fill these gaps.
- **Ambiguities**: The interaction with non-technical stakeholders requires further clarification to ensure accessibility.

## 2. Enumerate Project Assumptions
### Assumptions:
- **Technologies**: n8n workflows and RAgent are assumed as existing and stable platforms.
- **Teams**: It is assumed that there will be dedicated teams for development, quality assurance, and project management.
- **APIs**: Existing APIs from n8n and RAgent can be adapted without significant modification.
- **Timelines**: The project timeline appears aggressive, yet the expectation is to adhere strictly, highlighting the need for efficient workflows.

### Constraints:
- **Budget**: Although the budget is acknowledged as constrained, specifics need finalization.
- **Infrastructure**: Necessity to compatibly integrate with current n8n and RAgent platforms.
- **Tools**: All tools (AutoCoder, pytest, GitHub) must be operable within current IT infrastructure.

## 3. Initial Risks and Unknowns
### Identified Risks:
- **Integration Challenges**: Potential difficulties in integrating the system with n8n and RAgent workflows.
- **Resource Limitations**: The project depends heavily on the availability of team resources and technology updates.
- **System Stability**: Ensuring the new AI system functions reliably alongside existing systems.

### Unknowns:
- **Open Questions**: Clarity is needed on specifics like the design approval role, final review teams, and new AI capabilities.
- **[TODO] Markers**: Assurance of functional and technology alignment documents should have `[TODO]` markers, particularly in the Goals and Tools sections, as more specifications become available.

## 4. Preliminary Architecture Thoughts
### Architectural Patterns:
- **Clear Patterns**: The adherence to n8n and RAgent indicates reliance on modular architecture to facilitate integration.
- **Modules/Components**: Known components such as the dashboard interface, integration modules with n8n, and the primary Blane AI module.

### Design Ideas:
- **Robust Interface Layer**: Developing a clear interface layer for Blane to interact with other system components.
- **Error Handling Mechanism**: Prioritize the creation of adaptive and robust error handling and recovery systems for continuous operation.
- **Integration Layer**: A separate integration layer might be beneficial to handle communications with n8n workflows, enhancing reliability and reducing burden on core AI systems.

This document has provided a comprehensive assessment that sets the foundation for subsequent phases, ensuring precise alignment with the established project objectives. Further refinements and missing items need addressing in upcoming meetings to ensure robust planning and execution.
