## Introduction

This technical specification provides a comprehensive blueprint for the development of the AI-Powered Project Management System, known as "Project Factory," under the leadership of Blane, the Office Director. The document integrates the previously outlined technical design and implementation plans, aiming to guide developers through the project lifecycle stages.

---

## Project Overview

The primary objective is to create a project management system that enhances project efficiency and visibility through AI-driven automation. This system, leveraging real-time dashboards and integrated workflows, aims to support multiple projects with minimal intervention. It is expected to translate high-level directives into structured plans and workflows, thereby improving visibility and efficiency for stakeholders.

### Goals
- Develop a comprehensive AI-powered project management system.
- Integrate real-time dashboards for status monitoring.
- Ensure compatibility with existing RAgent and n8n workflows.
- Minimize human intervention with robust error handling and recovery processes.

## System Architecture

### System Overview

The architecture of the AI-Powered Project Management System is based on a modular design. It is designed to ensure connectivity and interoperability with existing systems such as RAgent and n8n, alongside offering robust real-time project management features.

### Components

| Module                    | Role                                                                       |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ProjectFactory**        | Core module managing lifecycle orchestration.                              |
| **DashboardInterface**    | Provides real-time visualization of project data.                          |
| **IntegrationAgent**      | Handles integration with n8n and RAgent workflows.                         |
| **ErrorHandler**          | Manages errors and facilitates system recovery.                            |
| **Scheduler**             | Manages project timelines and scheduling tasks.                            |

### Data Flow and Control Logic Summary

The system will utilize JSON-based input/output formats for data exchange. The control logic will be orchestrated through a main processor module, with a real-time dashboard and automated workflows handled via the AI-driven components.

---

## Technical Design

Each component of the system has a distinct role and is implemented using a class-based structure, promoting modularity and reusability.

### Modules and Functional Overview

#### ProjectFactory

- **Purpose**: Manages project lifecycle from initiation through execution and closure.
- **Inputs**: Project directives (.goal.yaml, .charter.md, .project_plan.yaml).
- **Outputs**: Project status reports, updates to the dashboard (.json format).

#### DashboardInterface

- **Purpose**: Provides real-time project visibility.
- **Inputs**: Status updates from ProjectFactory.
- **Outputs**: Visual dashboards for technical and non-technical stakeholders.

#### IntegrationAgent

- **Purpose**: Connects and synchronizes the system with RAgent and n8n workflows.
- **Inputs**: API data, configuration files.
- **Outputs**: Orchestrated workflows, updated project tasks.

#### ErrorHandler

- **Purpose**: Detects and manages errors, facilitating recovery.
- **Inputs**: Error logs and exceptions.
- **Outputs**: Error reports, system alerts.

#### Scheduler

- **Purpose**: Coordinates project timelines and tasks.
- **Inputs**: Project plans, task dependencies.
- **Outputs**: Scheduled tasks, alerts for upcoming milestones.

---

## Interfaces & Dependencies

- **APIs**: The system interfaces with existing RAgent and n8n workflows using their provided APIs.
- **Data Files**: Consumes and produces files in .yaml, .md, and .json formats.
- **Shared Files**: Utilizes shared directories for collaborative data exchange.

---

## Testing Plan

- **Unit Tests**: Each module will include unit tests to validate functionality and edge cases.
- **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive testing across modules to ensure seamless interaction.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Test scenarios addressing common and extreme use cases of the system.
- **CLI Invocation Examples**: Validating command-line interface interactions.

## Files & Directories

| Path                                       | Description                                       |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `/projects/ai_project_management/goals/`   | Contains goal specification files                 |
| `/projects/ai_project_management/charters/`| Holds project charter documents                   |
| `/projects/ai_project_management/deliverables/`| Stores final deliverables                        |
| `/projects/ai_project_management/dashboard/`| Output JSON dashboards for project tracking       |

---

## Code Snippets

```python
class ProjectFactory:
    def initiate_project(self, goal_file, charter_file):
        # Logic to initiate a project from specified goal and charter
        pass

class DashboardInterface:
    def update_dashboard(self, status_data):
        # Logic to update real-time dashboard
        pass
```

Additional code snippets will be included in the implementation to demonstrate key algorithms or processing logic.

---

## Security / Permissions

- Ensure secure access controls for all interfaces, particularly for APIs and shared files.
- Decouple sensitive data from non-critical logic, maintaining rigorous data permission boundaries.

---

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Technical design approved
- [ ] All code modules implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive tests written and passed
- [ ] Final outputs reviewed by stakeholders
- [ ] System live and operational post-deployment
