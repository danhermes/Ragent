# Implementation Meeting

## Worker_Woz

Creating a Technical Implementation Document as specified is an involved task requiring detailed breakdowns of system components, rigorously defined interfaces, and consideration of security and performance aspects. Below is an outline for a document structured according to the detailed requirements provided. Note that, due to constraints here, I'll give an overview with some examples to guide your larger-scale implementation.

# Technical Implementation Document

**Project: Project Factory System with AI Director (Blane)**

**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Owner:** [Insert Owner]

---

## Introduction
The objective of this document is to provide a detailed technical implementation plan for the Project Factory system which automates project planning and execution with real-time monitoring capabilities and minimal human intervention.

---

## Module Overview

### 1. AI Director (Blane)

**Purpose:**  
To serve as the intelligent core that plans, monitors, and adjusts project workflows autonomously.

**Classes and Interfaces:**

- `Blane`: The main AI class responsible for high-level project management.
- `PlanGenerator`: Generates project plans and updates.

```python
class Blane:
    def __init__(self, project_data: dict):
        ...

    def generate_plan(self) -> str:
        """Generate a project plan based on input data."""
        ...

    def monitor_project(self) -> None:
        """Monitor ongoing project status."""
        ...

    def adjust_plan(self, issue_id: int) -> None:
        """Adjust the project plan based on identified issues."""
        ...
```

- **Runtime Considerations:**  
  Validate input data, handle intermittent data failures, set up auto-retry and circuit breaker mechanisms.

### 2. Real-time Dashboard

**Purpose:**  
To provide stakeholders with continuous visibility of project status and metrics.

**Classes and Interfaces:**

- `Dashboard`: The interface displaying real-time project data.
- `DataAggregator`: Gathers data for display.

```python
class Dashboard:
    def update_display(self) -> None:
        """Refresh the dashboard with the latest data."""
        ...

    def alert_stakeholders(self, issue_log: list) -> None:
        """Notify stakeholders of significant project issues."""
        ...
```

- **Runtime Considerations:**  
  Ensure data streams are resilient, incorporate failover mechanisms, and provide low-latency updates.

---

## Phase-to-Component Mapping

### Phases:
- **Plan:** Utilizes `Blane` and `PlanGenerator` to establish a comprehensive project plan.
  - Components: AI Director, Plan Generator

- **Schedule:** Utilizes timeline modules for scheduling with automated reminders and alerts.
  - Components: TaskScheduler

- **Execute and Project Work:** Driven primarily by worker and sub-system modules coordinating various tasks.
  - Components: TaskExecutor, ResourceAllocator

- **Standup:** AI Director manages standup reports through data from `Dashboard` and updates using cross-module communication.
  - Components: Dashboard, Blane

- **Dashboard:** Involves all components to ensure real-time updates.
  - Components: All data interfacing modules

---

## Integration Specifications

- **API Contract:** A RESTful API with endpoints for plan retrieval (`GET /plans`), data submission (`POST /data`), and status updates (`PATCH /status`).

- **Authentication/Authorization:** Utilize OAuth 2.0 for secure access.

- **Error Handling Protocols:** Implement retry logic for REST calls, employ dead letter queues for failed messages, and maintain consistent state throughout distributed transactions.

## Implementation Details
### Method Signature Examples:

```python
def generate_plan(self) -> str:
    """
    Generate a project plan.

    Returns:
        str: The formatted project plan.
    """
    # logic to synthesize plan
    ...

def update_dashboard(self, data_payload: dict) -> None:
    """
    Update the real-time dashboard.
    
    Parameters:
        data_payload (dict): Real-time data metrics for update.
    """
    # logic to refresh dashboard
    ...
```

- **State Transitions:** Employ versioning for data models to ensure backward compatibility.

---

## Security Model

- **Data Protection:** Encrypt all data at rest and in transit using AES-256 and TLS 1.2/1.3.

- **Audit Logging:** Record all access and modifications to sensitive project data, ensuring traceability.

- **Threat Modeling:** Regularly update the threat model to include new vulnerabilities identified through routine penetration testing and audits.

---

## Deliverable Validation

- **[TODO] Completion:** All placeholder code must be replaced with actual implementations. Ensure test hooks are clearly defined, and that outputs conform with established schemas and formats.

The above sections form the basis of your 15-20 page technical document. Provide detailed structural diagrams, pseudocode, and full method implementations. Ensure each section has actionable steps and clear definitions of deliverables.
