# Project Name
Project Factory System

## Summary
Develop the Project Factory system with Blane as the AI-powered Office Director. This system will translate high-level directives into structured project plans, activate agents, execute automated workflows, and maintain visibility through real-time dashboards.

## Project Type
code

## Objectives
- Create a comprehensive project management system that orchestrates the entire development lifecycle
- Implement a structured approach to goal setting, project planning, and deliverable generation
- Develop a dashboard for real-time project visibility and status monitoring
- Integrate with existing agent systems and n8n workflows
- Establish clear communication channels between system components

## Deliverables
- Goal file structure (`.goal.yaml`)
- Project charter template (`.charter.md`)
- Project plan generator (`.project_plan.yaml`)
- Scheduling system (`.schedule.json`)
- n8n workflow integration (`.workflow.json`)
- Dashboard interface (`.dashboard.json`)
- Documentation for system components and interfaces

## Known Constraints
- Must integrate with existing RAgent and n8n infrastructure
- System should support multiple concurrent projects
- Must provide clear visibility for non-technical stakeholders
- Should minimize human intervention while allowing for escalation when needed

## Definition of Done
- Complete system can process a goal from initial directive to completed project
- Dashboard provides real-time visibility into project status
- All system components communicate effectively
- Documentation is complete and accessible
- System can handle error conditions and recovery

## Phases and Milestones
- Phase 1: PLAN - Transform goals into structured project plans
- Phase 2: SCHEDULE - Assign resources and create timelines
- Phase 3: EXECUTE - Trigger workflows and initialize execution
- Phase 4: PROJECT WORK - Execute tasks and generate artifacts
- Phase 5: STANDUP - Monitor progress and handle issues
- Phase 6: DASHBOARD - Provide user interface and status monitoring

## Preferred Meeting Format
Daily standups with status reports from each system component

## Review Requirements
Regular milestone reviews at the completion of each phase
