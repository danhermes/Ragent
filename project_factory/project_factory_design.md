Here is the **revised and complete system specification** for **Blane – The Project Director System**, incorporating your notes, flow diagrams, and the newly inserted **Project Work** step between **Kickoff** and **Standup**.

---

# **Blane – The Project Director System**

**Role**:
Blane is the AI-powered Office Director. It translates Big Boss directives into structured project plans, activates agents, executes automated workflows (via n8n), and maintains visibility through real-time dashboards.

## **1. PLAN Phase**

### **Initiator**: Big Boss

### **Owner**: Blane

Blane receives high-level goals and initiates a structured planning cascade:

* **PLAN / GOALS**

  * Goal captured in `.goal` file (YAML)
  * Structured into a charter
* **PROJECTS**

  * Defined as discrete fragments with deliverables
* **PROJECT PLANS**

  * Drafted by RAgents
  * Contain timelines, milestones, dependencies
* **SCHEDULING & RESOURCES**

  * RAgents identify which agents, tools, or humans are needed
  * Timeline with resource availability

---

## **2. EXECUTE Phase**

Blane prepares everything needed to activate the plan:

* **PROJECT PLAN & SCHEDULE**

  * Frozen and finalized for dispatch
* **ENGAGE RESOURCES**

  * Match agents or tools (e.g., RAgent, n8n workflows, human assistants)
* **SCHEDULE TASKS**

  * Timebox steps
* **ACTIVATE AGENTS**

  * Send instructions to agents with task details
* **AGENT PLAN**

  * Each agent receives its own version of the task tree

---

## **3. PROJECT KICKOFF**

The technical launch of a project:

* **CREATE N8N TASKS**

  * Generate `*.workflow.json` files
* **IMPORT TO N8N**

  * Load into n8n orchestrator
* **RUN PROJECT**

  * Launch workflows, begin execution
* **FEEDBACK LOOP TO BLANE**

  * Early status, validation, error checking

---

## **4. PROJECT WORK** ← *NEW STEP*

The heart of execution:

* **Agents and Automations Do the Work**

  * n8n runs jobs, calls APIs, parses data
  * Other agents follow plans and execute code
* **Status Signals Collected**

  * Success, error, progress, ETA
* **Workflows Adjusted If Needed**

  * Agents can pause, re-plan, escalate, or retry
* **All Output Routed to Logs and Blane**

---

## **5. PROJECT STANDUP**

Daily project sync cycle:

* **Daily Report Sent to Blane**

  * Timestamped updates from each agent or workflow
* **Blane Aggregates and Analyzes**

  * Looks for drift, missed steps, new blockers
* **Optional Escalations to HiL (Human-in-the-Loop)**

  * If issues require manual intervention
* **Prepares Inputs for Dashboard**

---

## **6. DASHBOARD ("Big Boss Dashboard")**

A live interface, curated by Blane, with project-wide visibility.

### **For Each Project:**

* **PHASE I, II, III (or more)**

  * Each phase tracked with status:

    * `pending`, `in progress`, `completed`, `blocked`
* **RECENT UPDATES**

  * Most recent events
  * Escalations, completions, anomalies
* **Shared with Big Boss**

  * Summary view or interactive interface

## **Core Entities & Interfaces**

| Component       | Format / Tool        | Description                               |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Goal File       | `.goal.yaml`         | Initial goal description                  |
| Project Charter | `.charter.md`        | Structured version of goal                |
| Project Plan    | `.project_plan.yaml` | Agent-generated milestone & task document |
| Schedule        | `.schedule.json`     | Resource allocation & timeline            |
| n8n Workflow    | `.workflow.json`     | Execution logic for automation            |
| Dashboard Data  | `.dashboard.json`    | Blane’s summarized state per project      |

---

## **Agent Roles**

* **RAgents**: Generate plans, schedules, specifications
* **n8n**: Executes automated tasks/workflows
* **Blane**: Oversees, dispatches, analyzes, reports
* **HiL** (optional): Human review or intervention

---

## **Next Enhancements (Optional)**

* Add **Logging Layer** per agent for debugging + rollback
* Integrate **Slack/Email** updates for STANDUP
* Make the DASHBOARD live-view (e.g., React UI fed by JSON)

Let me know if you want this exported to Markdown, YAML spec, or a working code template for integration with your existing RAgent and n8n stack.
