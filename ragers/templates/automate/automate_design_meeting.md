### 🧱 Meeting protocol — a consistent set of prompts or headings — that Ragers follow every time they write a report. Think of it as a technical version of Robert's Rules of Order, but for agent engineers.
Each topic becomes a section, and each section produces *atomic*, *reusable*, *agent-runnable* material.

# Ragent Meeting Agenda - Architecture Design
**Date:**  
**Phase:** Meeting | In Progress | Final  
**Owner:**

## 🎯 Goals
- What are we building or solving?
- What constraints or mandates exist?
- What will success look like?

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture
- System Overview
- Component Breakdown (with names)
- Data flow or control logic summary
- Known constraints (compute, file I/O, agent memory, etc.)

### Components
| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
|        |      |

## 💻 Code Snippets
```yaml
module:
  name: ""
  purpose: ""
  inputs: []
  outputs: []
  methods: []
  notes: ""
```

## 🧪 Test Plan
- Test coverage requirements
- Testing approach
- Key test scenarios

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Constraints
- Technical risks
- Style/narrative constraints
- Test mode limitations
- Potential conflicts or edge cases

---

## 🚦 Blockers & Decisions
- Any unresolved technical or creative blockers?
- Any forks in direction that need resolution?

Extra Meeting Prompt (to enforce this during meetings)
> "Please conduct this design meeting using the following structure: Goals, Architecture, Code Specs, Risks, Blockers, and Next Steps. Use tight formatting, eliminate narrative fluff, and keep code clean and executable."
