### Suggested Format for "Ragent Meeting Memos"
**meeting protocol** — a consistent set of prompts or headings — that Ragers follow every time they write a report. Think of it as a technical version of Robert's Rules of Order, but for agent engineers.
Each topic becomes a section, and each section produces *atomic*, *reusable*, *agent-runnable* material.
