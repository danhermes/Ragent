# Technical Design – Code Project

This document provides the full technical specification required to design, implement, and review a Code-mode project.

---

## Module Name
What is the name of the primary code module or system to be created?

---

## Purpose
What problem does this solve? What is the objective of this module?

---

## Functional Overview
Describe what the module does, its role, and behavior.

---

## Inputs
What inputs does this module expect? (files, data formats, API calls)

---

## Outputs
What outputs does it generate? (files, responses, state updates)

---

## Interfaces & Dependencies
Describe how this module interacts with others (APIs, shared files, databases).

---

## Core Logic / Structure
Break down the internal architecture.

### Submodules or Classes
- `MainProcessor`
- `DataLoader`
- `ErrorHandler`

### Internal Flow
Explain the main execution path or control flow.

---

## Testing Plan
How will the code be tested?

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Edge case handling
- CLI invocation examples

---

## Files & Directories

## Code Snippets

Include representative examples of key functions, classes, or processing logic. This helps reviewers visualize complexity and understand conventions.


Additional snippets encouraged:
- Main loop or entrypoint
- CLI parser / interface layer
- Any complex algorithmic logic
- Retry or error handling examples

---

## Security / Permissions
Any sensitive data, credentials, or permission boundaries?

---

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Technical design approved
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passed
- [ ] Output reviewed
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off
