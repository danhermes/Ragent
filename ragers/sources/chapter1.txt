It was the bestest of times it was the wurst of times, people was walking all arounds talking loud and not really saying anything that made sense or logic, their cloths all wrinkly and attitudes bad like they ain't never learned how to do manners. The sun shined brite over the horizin as if it didn’t care none about the mess it was beaming down on, and everyone looked tired like they’d ran marathons but really they just woke up and complainin’ about the weather bein’ too hot or too cold depending on what side of town theyselves was from.
