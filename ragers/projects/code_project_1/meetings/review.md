## 1. Final Technical Architecture

### System Overview
The Senior Employee Identification System is a lightweight, local solution that extracts HR data from CSV/JSON files, applies strict validation (including exclusion of contractors and founder’s family), evaluates employee tenure, and generates a validated PDF report along with detailed Markdown documentation. This system is designed for small-scale use and relies solely on local resources, ensuring data privacy and compliance with internal policies.

### Module Breakdown & Components

| Module                              | Role                                                                        |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Extraction Module              | Reads and parses employee records from CSV/JSON files.                     |
| Data Validation & Filtering Module  | Validates record structure and excludes contractors and founder’s family.   |
| Qualification Rule Engine           | Checks if each record meets the ≥10 years tenure requirement.               |
| Report Generation Module            | Generates a PDF report and creates supplementary Markdown documentation.    |
| Methodology Documentation Module    | Archives decision logs and processing details for traceability.             |

### Integration & Interface Contracts
- **Interfaces (Function Signatures):**
  - extract_employee_data(filepath: str) → list  
  - validate_and_filter_data(data: list) → list  
  - check_tenure_qualification(data: list, min_years: int = 10) → list  
  - generate_report(qualified_employees: list, output_path: str) → None  
  - generate_documentation(details: dict, output_path: str) → None  

These interfaces allow each module to integrate seamlessly in a local, file-based workflow and support independent testing.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 2. Implementation Feasibility Confirmation
- **Approach:** A simple Python scripting solution using libraries such as pandas, ReportLab or matplotlib, and Markdown/PyYAML is feasible given the small-scale HR data.
- **Local Environment:** Implementation will run locally on designated workstations using existing CSV/JSON files without the need for external APIs or cloud resources.
- **Modularity:** The design is modular, allowing each component to be developed, tested, and maintained separately.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 3. Risk Mitigation Plan

### Identified Risks & Mitigation Strategies

- **Data Inaccuracy:**  
  - Mitigation: Implement rigorous data validation checks (e.g., type checking, format verification) in the extraction module.  
  - Testing: Unit tests will cover various edge cases and formats.

- **Exclusion Rule Misapplication:**  
  - Mitigation: Enforce unit tests specifically targeting exclusion filters.  
  - Process: Regular rule verification meetings to ensure criteria are correctly applied.

- **Project Delays:**  
  - Mitigation: Hold weekly progress reviews and adjust assignments as needed.  
  - Monitoring: Use task boards and continuous updates on GitHub.

- **Performance Bottlenecks:**  
  - Mitigation: Optimize file I/O operations and refactor if data volume increases.  
  - Testing: Utilize integration tests to measure module performance.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. Resource Allocation

- **Existing Assets:** HR CSV/JSON files are already available.
- **Team Roles:**
  - **Project Lead:** Oversees overall progress and coordinates between technical and documentation teams.
  - **Data Specialist:** Implements extraction, validation, and tenure evaluation modules.
  - **Documentation Specialist:** Maintains all project documentation, ensures methodology traceability.
- **Execution Environment:** Local workstations with Python 3.x and related libraries; version control via GitHub.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Quality Assurance Process

- **Unit Testing:**  
  - Each function will be individually verified using edge case tests (e.g., missing fields, corrupted formats).
- **Integration Testing:**  
  - Ensure correct data flow across modules (e.g., output from Data Extraction feeds correctly into Validation).
- **Regression Testing:**  
  - Continuous testing using CI (e.g., GitHub Actions) to ensure code changes do not break functionality.
- **Documentation Reviews:**  
  - All design and methodology documentation will be peer-reviewed to ensure clear traceability and consistency with project objectives.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Deployment Strategy

- **Local Deployment:**  
  - The system will be deployed on designated workstations without reliance on external servers.  
- **Version Control:**  
  - All code and documentation are maintained in a GitHub repository with regular commits and code reviews.
- **Output Delivery:**  
  - Final PDF reports and Markdown documentation will be stored in `/projects/senior_employee_identification/deliverables/` and archived in the GitHub repository.
- **Release Checkpoints:**  
  - Follow-up meetings (next progress review on November 15) will verify integration and readiness before the final sign-off.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Maintenance Plan

- **Post-Deployment Support:**  
  - The project team will monitor the system for any issues during initial use and address reported bugs.
- **Updates & Enhancements:**  
  - Future improvements (e.g., additional exclusion criteria or performance optimizations) will be planned and implemented as needed.
- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - All changes and enhancements will be documented in the methodology documentation, ensuring ongoing traceability.
- **Periodic Reviews:**  
  - Scheduled reviews post-deployment to verify continued compliance with internal data privacy guidelines and technical standards.
