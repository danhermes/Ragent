## 1. Complete Technical Architecture

### System Overview
The Senior Employee Identification System is a lightweight, local solution that extracts HR data from CSV/JSON files, validates and filters out records (excluding contractors and founder’s family), evaluates tenure criteria, and generates a validated PDF report along with supplementary Markdown documentation. The design emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and adherence to data privacy requirements.

### Module Breakdown & Components
| Module                            | Role                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Extraction Module            | Read and parse employee records from CSV/JSON files.                 |
| Data Validation & Filtering Module| Validate record structure and apply exclusion rules.                 |
| Qualification Rule Engine         | Check if each record meets the 10+ years tenure criteria.            |
| Report Generation Module          | Generate a PDF report and create Markdown documentation.             |
| Methodology Documentation Module  | Capture and archive decision logs and processing criteria.           |

### Integration & Interface Contracts
- Interfaces are defined as simple Python functions:
  - extract_employee_data(filepath) → list
  - validate_and_filter_data(data) → list
  - check_tenure_qualification(data, min_years=10) → list
  - generate_report(qualified_employees, output_path) → None
  - generate_documentation(details, output_path) → None

These interfaces support integration within a local, file-based workflow and enable each module to operate and be independently testable.

## 2. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Identified Risks
- **Data Inaccuracy**: Input files may contain corrupted or unexpected formats.
- **Exclusion Rule Misapplication**: Risk of incorrectly including contractors or family members.
- **Project Delays**: Dependencies between sequential module development can introduce risks.
- **Performance Issues**: Repeated parsing of files may lead to delays if data volume increases.

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Data Validation Checks**: Implement rigorous parsing and type-checking routines in the extraction module.
- **Rule Verification Testing**: Develop unit tests to ensure exclusion filters work correctly.
- **Regular Progress Reviews**: Schedule checkpoints (e.g., November 15) to assess module readiness and coordinate integration.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Optimize file I/O routines and comment code for easier refactoring later if data volumes rise.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 3. Resource Requirements and Constraints

### Resource Requirements
- **Existing Assets**: Use current HR CSV/JSON files and local workstations.
- **Programming Environment**: Python 3.x, supporting libraries (pandas, ReportLab/matplotlib, PyYAML/Markdown).
- **Version Control**: GitHub for source control.
- **Team Roles**:
  - Project Lead: Oversees progress and coordination.
  - Data Specialist: Implements extraction, filtering, and validation logic.
  - Documentation Specialist: Maintains detailed methodology and usage docs.

### Constraints
- No usage of external APIs, cloud storage, enterprise servers, or microservices.
- Strict adherence to data privacy and exclusion rules.
- Designed for small-scale data processing within local environments.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. Test Coverage Plan

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Each module’s function will have dedicated tests covering edge cases and error handling (e.g., invalid file formats, missing fields).
- **Integration Testing**: Validate end-to-end workflows from data extraction through report generation.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure that updates do not break existing functionalities.

### Key Test Scenarios
- Validate that CSV/JSON files are correctly parsed into structured records.
- Ensure filtering functions remove contractors and founder’s family members.
- Verify that the tenure evaluator only includes employees with ≥10 years.
- Confirm that the generated PDF report and Markdown documentation are non-empty and correctly formatted.

Sample unit test for tenure qualification:
```python
def test_check_tenure_qualification():
    test_records = [
        {"employee_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "tenure": 12, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"},
        {"employee_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "tenure": 8, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"}
    ]
    qualified = check_tenure_qualification(test_records, min_years=10)
    assert len(qualified) == 1
    assert qualified[0]["name"] == "Alice"
```

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Integration Specifications

- **Interfaces**: Each module exposes functions that allow chaining outputs directly into the next module.
- **Module Dependencies**: 
  - The output of the Data Extraction Module feeds into the Data Validation & Filtering Module.
  - Validated data is passed sequentially to the Qualification Rule Engine.
  - Outputs from the rule engine feed both the Report Generation and Documentation Modules.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Consistent error logging via a dedicated Logger ensures traceability.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Performance Requirements

- **Small-Scale Data**: Optimized for local processing of HR records in the range of a few hundred employees.
- **Modular Efficiency**: Code modules are designed to be lightweight and fast in execution. Any performance bottlenecks (e.g., file I/O operations) will be addressed during integration testing.
- **Future Scalability**: Although designed for small-scale use (no enterprise architecture), the modular design allows for future refactoring if data volumes increase.

## 7. Implementation Timeline and Phases
