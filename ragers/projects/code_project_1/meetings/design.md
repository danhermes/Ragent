**PROBLEM ANALYSIS**

The task at hand involves leveraging a small-scale technical project to identify senior employees who have over ten years of tenure while excluding contractors and family of the founder. This process must utilize existing HR database records, automate the data extraction, ensure data integrity, and provide a validated report. The project is constrained to use simple scripts without the need for enterprise infrastructure, focusing on internal resources and ensuring data privacy compliance.

# Code Design Meeting – Design Document

This document summarizes key technical design decisions and provides diagrams and specifications for the Senior Employee Identification System. The design focuses on a small-scale project using simple scripting and available assets. All architecture components, data flows, and security measures have been discussed and agreed upon.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 1. System Architecture Diagram

Below is a high-level system architecture diagram using Mermaid syntax to illustrate the components and their interactions:

```mermaid

  A[HR Database (CSV/JSON Files)] --> B[Data Extraction Module]
  B --> C[Data Validation & Filtering Module]
  C --> D[Qualification Rule Engine]
  D --> E[Report Generation Module]
  E --> F[Final Validated Report (PDF)]
  D --> G[Methodology Documentation Generator]
  G --> H[Documentation Archive]
  
  %% Additional processing feedback loop
  H -- Verification --> C
```

**Key Components:**
- **Data Extraction Module:** Reads the employee records from local files.
- **Data Validation & Filtering Module:** Validates and applies exclusion criteria (e.g., filtering out contractors and founder's family).
- **Qualification Rule Engine:** Determines if employees meet the ≥10 years tenure requirement.
- **Report Generation Module:** Generates a PDF report listing at least three qualified, senior employees.
- **Methodology Documentation Generator:** Prepares the supporting documentation (in Markdown) for process traceability.
- **Documentation Archive:** Stores all final documents and relevant logs.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 2. Technology Stack Details

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x  
  - Chosen for its simplicity in scripting, data processing, and generating reports.
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**  
  - pandas – For CSV/JSON parsing and data manipulation.
  - matplotlib or ReportLab – For generating PDF reports (if graphical output is needed).
  - PyYAML/Markdown – For documentation creation and formatting.
- **Version Control:** Git (hosted on GitHub)  
  - Ensures traceability and collaboration.
- **Automation Tool:** AutoCoder  
  - Used for workflow triggers and ensuring adherence to development standards.
- **Local Environment:**  
  - No enterprise infrastructure; all processing is done on local machines or designated workstations.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 3. Data Flow Diagram

The following diagram details the data flow from input to output, ensuring validation and security.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Input: Employee Records (CSV/JSON)]
  B[Data Extraction Module]
  C[Data Validation Module]
  D[Exclusion Filter (Contractors, Founder’s Family)]
  E[Qualification Check (≥10 Years)]
  F[Data Aggregation]
  G[Report Generation]
  H[Output: Validated Report & Methodology Documentation]
  
  A --> B
  B --> C
  C --> D
  D --> E
  E --> F
  F --> G
  G --> H
```

**Data Flow Details:**
- Employee records are ingested from CSV/JSON sources.
- The extraction module parses and cleans the data.
- Validation rules are applied to ensure data integrity.
- Filters exclude records that do not meet the criteria.
- Aggregation compiles the final list of qualified employees.
- The report generation module produces the final deliverables.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. API Specifications

Even though no external APIs or server endpoints are required for this small-scale project, an internal (local) interface specification is defined for potential expansion:

- **Function:** extract_employee_data(filepath: str) → DataFrame  
  - **Description:** Reads employee records from a CSV or JSON file and returns a structured DataFrame.
  
- **Function:** validate_and_filter_data(data: DataFrame) → DataFrame  
  - **Description:** Applies validation checks and exclusion filters (e.g., contractors, founder’s family).
  
- **Function:** check_tenure_qualification(data: DataFrame, years: int=10) → List[str]  
  - **Description:** Returns a list of employee names that meet or exceed the specified tenure.
  
- **Function:** generate_report(qualified_employees: List[str], output_path: str) → None  
  - **Description:** Generates a PDF report of the qualified employees along with execution details.
  
- **Function:** generate_documentation(details: dict, output_path: str) → None  
  - **Description:** Produces Markdown documentation of the methodology, criteria, and process steps.

These functions will serve as the internal API for our script which can be later integrated or expanded if needed.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Security Architecture

**Security Considerations:**
- **Data Privacy:**  
  - Process only locally stored HR records in CSV/JSON format.
  - Ensure that personal identifiers are handled following internal data privacy guidelines.
  
- **Access Controls:**  
  - The script runs on designated secure workstations with restricted access.
  - Documentation is stored in a controlled GitHub repository.
  
- **Audit Trail:**  
  - Maintain logs for data extraction, validation steps, and modifications for traceability.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  - The system is designed to catch and log errors, ensuring that all anomalies are documented for review.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Scalability Design

**Scalability Measures:**
- **Modular Architecture:**  
  - Each component (extraction, validation, filtering, reporting) is modular.  
  - Modules can be enhanced or replaced independently as new requirements emerge.
  
- **Future Expansion:**  
  - While the current project uses local files and basic scripting, the design supports future refactoring toward a more service-oriented architecture if APIs or cloud-based processing become necessary.
  
- **Resource Efficiency:**  
  - The implementation is optimized for small data sets but is designed such that switching to batch processing would be straightforward in the future.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Deployment Architecture

**Deployment Considerations:**
- **Local Deployment:**  
  - The project runs from a local workstation or designated development machine.
  - All processing remains on-premises without reliance on external servers.
  
- **Version Control and CI:**  
  - Code is managed via GitHub with regular commits and reviews.
  - Automated tests (if introduced) will run locally via a simple CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to ensure integrity.
  
- **Reporting Delivery:**  
  - Final reports (PDF) and documentation are stored in the `/projects/senior_employee_identification/deliverables/` folder.
  - The final documentation is also archived in the project’s GitHub repository to maintain traceability.

────────────────────────────────────────────
