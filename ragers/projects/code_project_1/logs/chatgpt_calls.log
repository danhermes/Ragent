# Code Design Meeting – Design Document

This document summarizes key technical design decisions and provides diagrams and specifications for the Senior Employee Identification System. The design focuses on a small-scale project using simple scripting and available assets. All architecture components, data flows, and security measures have been discussed and agreed upon.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 1. System Architecture Diagram

Below is a high-level system architecture diagram using Mermaid syntax to illustrate the components and their interactions:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[HR Database (CSV/JSON Files)] --> B[Data Extraction Module]
  B --> C[Data Validation & Filtering Module]
  C --> D[Qualification Rule Engine]
  D --> E[Report Generation Module]
  E --> F[Final Validated Report (PDF)]
  D --> G[Methodology Documentation Generator]
  G --> H[Documentation Archive]
  
  %% Additional processing feedback loop
  H -- Verification --> C
```

**Key Components:**
- **Data Extraction Module:** Reads the employee records from local files.
- **Data Validation & Filtering Module:** Validates and applies exclusion criteria (e.g., filtering out contractors and founder's family).
- **Qualification Rule Engine:** Determines if employees meet the ≥10 years tenure requirement.
- **Report Generation Module:** Generates a PDF report listing at least three qualified, senior employees.
- **Methodology Documentation Generator:** Prepares the supporting documentation (in Markdown) for process traceability.
- **Documentation Archive:** Stores all final documents and relevant logs.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 2. Technology Stack Details

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x  
  - Chosen for its simplicity in scripting, data processing, and generating reports.
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**  
  - pandas – For CSV/JSON parsing and data manipulation.
  - matplotlib or ReportLab – For generating PDF reports (if graphical output is needed).
  - PyYAML/Markdown – For documentation creation and formatting.
- **Version Control:** Git (hosted on GitHub)  
  - Ensures traceability and collaboration.
- **Automation Tool:** AutoCoder  
  - Used for workflow triggers and ensuring adherence to development standards.
- **Local Environment:**  
  - No enterprise infrastructure; all processing is done on local machines or designated workstations.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 3. Data Flow Diagram

The following diagram details the data flow from input to output, ensuring validation and security.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Input: Employee Records (CSV/JSON)]
  B[Data Extraction Module]
  C[Data Validation Module]
  D[Exclusion Filter (Contractors, Founder’s Family)]
  E[Qualification Check (≥10 Years)]
  F[Data Aggregation]
  G[Report Generation]
  H[Output: Validated Report & Methodology Documentation]
  
  A --> B
  B --> C
  C --> D
  D --> E
  E --> F
  F --> G
  G --> H
```

**Data Flow Details:**
- Employee records are ingested from CSV/JSON sources.
- The extraction module parses and cleans the data.
- Validation rules are applied to ensure data integrity.
- Filters exclude records that do not meet the criteria.
- Aggregation compiles the final list of qualified employees.
- The report generation module produces the final deliverables.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. API Specifications

Even though no external APIs or server endpoints are required for this small-scale project, an internal (local) interface specification is defined for potential expansion:

- **Function:** extract_employee_data(filepath: str) → DataFrame  
  - **Description:** Reads employee records from a CSV or JSON file and returns a structured DataFrame.
  
- **Function:** validate_and_filter_data(data: DataFrame) → DataFrame  
  - **Description:** Applies validation checks and exclusion filters (e.g., contractors, founder’s family).
  
- **Function:** check_tenure_qualification(data: DataFrame, years: int=10) → List[str]  
  - **Description:** Returns a list of employee names that meet or exceed the specified tenure.
  
- **Function:** generate_report(qualified_employees: List[str], output_path: str) → None  
  - **Description:** Generates a PDF report of the qualified employees along with execution details.
  
- **Function:** generate_documentation(details: dict, output_path: str) → None  
  - **Description:** Produces Markdown documentation of the methodology, criteria, and process steps.

These functions will serve as the internal API for our script which can be later integrated or expanded if needed.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Security Architecture

**Security Considerations:**
- **Data Privacy:**  
  - Process only locally stored HR records in CSV/JSON format.
  - Ensure that personal identifiers are handled following internal data privacy guidelines.
  
- **Access Controls:**  
  - The script runs on designated secure workstations with restricted access.
  - Documentation is stored in a controlled GitHub repository.
  
- **Audit Trail:**  
  - Maintain logs for data extraction, validation steps, and modifications for traceability.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  - The system is designed to catch and log errors, ensuring that all anomalies are documented for review.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Scalability Design

**Scalability Measures:**
- **Modular Architecture:**  
  - Each component (extraction, validation, filtering, reporting) is modular.  
  - Modules can be enhanced or replaced independently as new requirements emerge.
  
- **Future Expansion:**  
  - While the current project uses local files and basic scripting, the design supports future refactoring toward a more service-oriented architecture if APIs or cloud-based processing become necessary.
  
- **Resource Efficiency:**  
  - The implementation is optimized for small data sets but is designed such that switching to batch processing would be straightforward in the future.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Deployment Architecture

**Deployment Considerations:**
- **Local Deployment:**  
  - The project runs from a local workstation or designated development machine.
  - All processing remains on-premises without reliance on external servers.
  
- **Version Control and CI:**  
  - Code is managed via GitHub with regular commits and reviews.
  - Automated tests (if introduced) will run locally via a simple CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to ensure integrity.
  
- **Reporting Delivery:**  
  - Final reports (PDF) and documentation are stored in the `/projects/senior_employee_identification/deliverables/` folder.
  - The final documentation is also archived in the project’s GitHub repository to maintain traceability.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## Meeting Closing Summary

- **Key Decisions:**
  - A modular architecture using Python is selected for the extraction, validation, filtering, and reporting.
  - A local deployment model with no external APIs or cloud dependencies fits the small-scale project requirement.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 1. System Architecture Diagram

Below is a high-level system architecture diagram using Mermaid syntax to illustrate the components and their interactions:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[HR Database (CSV/JSON Files)] --> B[Data Extraction Module]
  B --> C[Data Validation & Filtering Module]
  C --> D[Qualification Rule Engine]
  D --> E[Report Generation Module]
  E --> F[Final Validated Report (PDF)]
  D --> G[Methodology Documentation Generator]
  G --> H[Documentation Archive]
  
  %% Additional processing feedback loop
  H -- Verification --> C
```

**Key Components:**
- **Data Extraction Module:** Reads the employee records from local files.
- **Data Validation & Filtering Module:** Validates and applies exclusion criteria (e.g., filtering out contractors and founder's family).
- **Qualification Rule Engine:** Determines if employees meet the ≥10 years tenure requirement.
- **Report Generation Module:** Generates a PDF report listing at least three qualified, senior employees.
- **Methodology Documentation Generator:** Prepares the supporting documentation (in Markdown) for process traceability.
- **Documentation Archive:** Stores all final documents and relevant logs.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 2. Technology Stack Details

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x  
  - Chosen for its simplicity in scripting, data processing, and generating reports.
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**  
  - pandas – For CSV/JSON parsing and data manipulation.
  - matplotlib or ReportLab – For generating PDF reports (if graphical output is needed).
  - PyYAML/Markdown – For documentation creation and formatting.
- **Version Control:** Git (hosted on GitHub)  
  - Ensures traceability and collaboration.
- **Automation Tool:** AutoCoder  
  - Used for workflow triggers and ensuring adherence to development standards.
- **Local Environment:**  
  - No enterprise infrastructure; all processing is done on local machines or designated workstations.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 3. Data Flow Diagram

The following diagram details the data flow from input to output, ensuring validation and security.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Input: Employee Records (CSV/JSON)]
  B[Data Extraction Module]
  C[Data Validation Module]
  D[Exclusion Filter (Contractors, Founder’s Family)]
  E[Qualification Check (≥10 Years)]
  F[Data Aggregation]
  G[Report Generation]
  H[Output: Validated Report & Methodology Documentation]
  
  A --> B
  B --> C
  C --> D
  D --> E
  E --> F
  F --> G
  G --> H
```

**Data Flow Details:**
- Employee records are ingested from CSV/JSON sources.
- The extraction module parses and cleans the data.
- Validation rules are applied to ensure data integrity.
- Filters exclude records that do not meet the criteria.
- Aggregation compiles the final list of qualified employees.
- The report generation module produces the final deliverables.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. API Specifications

Even though no external APIs or server endpoints are required for this small-scale project, an internal (local) interface specification is defined for potential expansion:

- **Function:** extract_employee_data(filepath: str) → DataFrame  
  - **Description:** Reads employee records from a CSV or JSON file and returns a structured DataFrame.
  
- **Function:** validate_and_filter_data(data: DataFrame) → DataFrame  
  - **Description:** Applies validation checks and exclusion filters (e.g., contractors, founder’s family).
  
- **Function:** check_tenure_qualification(data: DataFrame, years: int=10) → List[str]  
  - **Description:** Returns a list of employee names that meet or exceed the specified tenure.
  
- **Function:** generate_report(qualified_employees: List[str], output_path: str) → None  
  - **Description:** Generates a PDF report of the qualified employees along with execution details.
  
- **Function:** generate_documentation(details: dict, output_path: str) → None  
  - **Description:** Produces Markdown documentation of the methodology, criteria, and process steps.

These functions will serve as the internal API for our script which can be later integrated or expanded if needed.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Security Architecture

**Security Considerations:**
- **Data Privacy:**  
  - Process only locally stored HR records in CSV/JSON format.
  - Ensure that personal identifiers are handled following internal data privacy guidelines.
  
- **Access Controls:**  
  - The script runs on designated secure workstations with restricted access.
  - Documentation is stored in a controlled GitHub repository.
  
- **Audit Trail:**  
  - Maintain logs for data extraction, validation steps, and modifications for traceability.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  - The system is designed to catch and log errors, ensuring that all anomalies are documented for review.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Scalability Design

**Scalability Measures:**
- **Modular Architecture:**  
  - Each component (extraction, validation, filtering, reporting) is modular.  
  - Modules can be enhanced or replaced independently as new requirements emerge.
  
- **Future Expansion:**  
  - While the current project uses local files and basic scripting, the design supports future refactoring toward a more service-oriented architecture if APIs or cloud-based processing become necessary.
  
- **Resource Efficiency:**  
  - The implementation is optimized for small data sets but is designed such that switching to batch processing would be straightforward in the future.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Deployment Architecture

**Deployment Considerations:**
- **Local Deployment:**  
  - The project runs from a local workstation or designated development machine.
  - All processing remains on-premises without reliance on external servers.
  
- **Version Control and CI:**  
  - Code is managed via GitHub with regular commits and reviews.
  - Automated tests (if introduced) will run locally via a simple CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to ensure integrity.
  
- **Reporting Delivery:**  
  - Final reports (PDF) and documentation are stored in the `/projects/senior_employee_identification/deliverables/` folder.
  - The final documentation is also archived in the project’s GitHub repository to maintain traceability.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## Meeting Closing Summary

### Code Snippet Example (Interface Contract)
```python
def extract_employee_data(filepath: str) -> list:
    """
    Reads employee data from a CSV or JSON file.
    
    Args:
      filepath: Path to the input file.
    Returns:
      List of employee records (dictionaries).
    """
    # implementation here
    pass

def validate_and_filter_data(data: list) -> list:
    """
    Validates employee record structure and applies exclusion rules.
    
    Args:
      data: List of employee records.
    Returns:
      Filtered list of employee records.
    """
    # implementation here
    pass

def check_tenure_qualification(data: list, min_years: int = 10) -> list:
    """
    Checks each record and determines if the employee has a tenure >= min_years.
    
    Args:
      data: List of filtered employee records.
      min_years: The minimum years of tenure.
    Returns:
      List of qualified employee records.
    """
    # implementation here
    pass

def generate_report(qualified_employees: list, output_path: str) -> None:
    """
    Generates a PDF report listing the qualified employees.
    
    Args:
      qualified_employees: List of employee records.
      output_path: File path for the generated PDF.
    """
    # implementation here
    pass
```

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. Data Models and Schemas

### Employee Record Schema
```json
{
  "employee_id": "string or integer",
  "name": "string",
  "tenure": "float or integer (years)",
  "employment_status": "string (e.g., full-time, contractor)",
  "relation_to_founder": "boolean or string (yes/no)"
}
```

### Validation Criteria:
- Tenure must be numeric and greater than or equal to 10.
- employment_status should not equal "contractor".
- relation_to_founder should be False or "no".

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Testing Strategy per Module

### Testing Approach:
- **Unit Tests:** Test each function individually with different edge cases (e.g., missing fields, incorrect data types).
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure data flows correctly between modules, e.g., data output from extractor feeds correctly into the validator.
- **Regression Tests:** Validate that future code changes do not break established functionality.

### Key Test Scenarios:
- Valid CSV/JSON input produces a correct list of employee records.
- Incorrect file format or missing records trigger expected validation errors.
- Exclusion filters correctly remove contractors and founder’s family.
- Tenure evaluation correctly identifies employees with ≥10 years.
- Report generation creates a non-empty PDF and correct markdown documentation.

### Sample Unit Test (using pytest)
```python
def test_check_tenure_qualification():
    test_records = [
        {"employee_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "tenure": 12, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"},
        {"employee_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "tenure": 8, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"}

2. **Data Validation & Filtering Module**
   - Define and implement data format checking and exclusion rules.
3. **Tenure Evaluation (Qualification Rule Engine)**
   - Code the function to check tenure criteria.
4. **Report Generation Module**
   - Create PDF generation and Markdown documentation functions.
5. **Integration Testing**
   - Combine modules and run through full end-to-end tests.
6. **Documentation and Code Review**
   - Update docs based on code modifiers and iterate based on team feedback.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Technical Debt Considerations

- **Short-Term Simplicity:**  
  - Use basic Python libraries; however, note that repeated parsing of large CSV/JSON files may need optimization.
- **Refactoring Possibilities:**  
  - As complexity grows, consider refactoring into separate classes for data I/O and business logic.
- **Testing Framework Expansion:**  
  - Initially use pytest, but potential to integrate Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines (like GitHub Actions) for regular testing.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Ensure inline comments are maintained. Code readability should be preserved as additional features are added.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Centralize error logging and handling mechanisms to reduce duplicate code in each module.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. API Specifications

Even though no external APIs or server endpoints are required for this small-scale project, an internal (local) interface specification is defined for potential expansion:

- **Function:** extract_employee_data(filepath: str) → DataFrame  
  - **Description:** Reads employee records from a CSV or JSON file and returns a structured DataFrame.
  
- **Function:** validate_and_filter_data(data: DataFrame) → DataFrame  
  - **Description:** Applies validation checks and exclusion filters (e.g., contractors, founder’s family).
  
- **Function:** check_tenure_qualification(data: DataFrame, years: int=10) → List[str]  
  - **Description:** Returns a list of employee names that meet or exceed the specified tenure.
  
- **Function:** generate_report(qualified_employees: List[str], output_path: str) → None  
  - **Description:** Generates a PDF report of the qualified employees along with execution details.
  
- **Function:** generate_documentation(details: dict, output_path: str) → None  
  - **Description:** Produces Markdown documentation of the methodology, criteria, and process steps.

These functions will serve as the internal API for our script which can be later integrated or expanded if needed.

## 4. Data Models and Schemas

### Employee Record Schema
```json
{
  "employee_id": "string or integer",
  "name": "string",
  "tenure": "float or integer (years)",
  "employment_status": "string (e.g., full-time, contractor)",
  "relation_to_founder": "boolean or string (yes/no)"
}
```

### Validation Criteria:
- Tenure must be numeric and greater than or equal to 10.
- employment_status should not equal "contractor".
- relation_to_founder should be False or "no".

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Testing Strategy per Module

### Testing Approach:
- **Unit Tests:** Test each function individually with different edge cases (e.g., missing fields, incorrect data types).
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure data flows correctly between modules, e.g., data output from extractor feeds correctly into the validator.
- **Regression Tests:** Validate that future code changes do not break established functionality.

### Key Test Scenarios:
- Valid CSV/JSON input produces a correct list of employee records.
- Incorrect file format or missing records trigger expected validation errors.
- Exclusion filters correctly remove contractors and founder’s family.
- Tenure evaluation correctly identifies employees with ≥10 years.
- Report generation creates a non-empty PDF and correct markdown documentation.

### Sample Unit Test (using pytest)
```python
def test_check_tenure_qualification():
    test_records = [
        {"employee_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "tenure": 12, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"},
        {"employee_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "tenure": 8, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"}
    ]
    qualified = check_tenure_qualification(test_records, min_years=10)
    assert len(qualified) == 1
    assert qualified[0]["name"] == "Alice"
```

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Implementation Priorities and Sequence

### Priority Order:
1. **Data Extraction Module**
   - Implement file reading functions (CSV/JSON) with error handling.
2. **Data Validation & Filtering Module**
   - Define and implement data format checking and exclusion rules.
3. **Tenure Evaluation (Qualification Rule Engine)**
   - Code the function to check tenure criteria.
4. **Report Generation Module**
   - Create PDF generation and Markdown documentation functions.
5. **Integration Testing**
   - Combine modules and run through full end-to-end tests.
6. **Documentation and Code Review**
   - Update docs based on code modifiers and iterate based on team feedback.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Technical Debt Considerations

- **Short-Term Simplicity:**  
  - Use basic Python libraries; however, note that repeated parsing of large CSV/JSON files may need optimization.
- **Refactoring Possibilities:**  
  - As complexity grows, consider refactoring into separate classes for data I/O and business logic.
- **Testing Framework Expansion:**  
  - Initially use pytest, but potential to integrate Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines (like GitHub Actions) for regular testing.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Ensure inline comments are maintained. Code readability should be preserved as additional features are added.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Centralize error logging and handling mechanisms to reduce duplicate code in each module.

RESPONSE:
----------------------------------------
Below is the complete technical design document (code_technical_design.md) that incorporates our meeting discussion, design evaluation, and action items. This document has been structured using our meeting protocol with clear sections and diagrams to ensure each agenda point is addressed.

────────────────────────────────────────────
# code_technical_design.md

## 1. Complete Technical Architecture

### System Overview
The Senior Employee Identification System is a lightweight, local solution that extracts HR data from CSV/JSON files, validates and filters out records (excluding contractors and founder’s family), evaluates tenure criteria, and generates a validated PDF report along with supplementary Markdown documentation. The design emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and adherence to data privacy requirements.

### Module Breakdown & Components
| Module                            | Role                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Extraction Module            | Read and parse employee records from CSV/JSON files.                 |
| Data Validation & Filtering Module| Validate record structure and apply exclusion rules.                 |
| Qualification Rule Engine         | Check if each record meets the 10+ years tenure criteria.            |
| Report Generation Module          | Generate a PDF report and create Markdown documentation.             |
| Methodology Documentation Module  | Capture and archive decision logs and processing criteria.           |

### Data Flow Diagram (Mermaid Syntax)
```mermaid

  A[HR Database (CSV/JSON)]
  --> B[Data Extraction Module]
  B --> C[Data Validation & Filtering Module]
  C --> D[Qualification Rule Engine]
  D --> E[Report Generation Module]
  D --> F[Methodology Documentation Module]
  E --> G[Final Validated Report (PDF)]
  F --> H[Documentation Archive (Markdown)]
```

### Integration & Interface Contracts
- Interfaces are defined as simple Python functions:
  - extract_employee_data(filepath) → list
  - validate_and_filter_data(data) → list
  - check_tenure_qualification(data, min_years=10) → list
  - generate_report(qualified_employees, output_path) → None
  - generate_documentation(details, output_path) → None

These interfaces support integration within a local, file-based workflow and enable each module to operate and be independently testable.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 2. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Identified Risks
- **Data Inaccuracy**: Input files may contain corrupted or unexpected formats.
- **Exclusion Rule Misapplication**: Risk of incorrectly including contractors or family members.
- **Project Delays**: Dependencies between sequential module development can introduce risks.
- **Performance Issues**: Repeated parsing of files may lead to delays if data volume increases.

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Data Validation Checks**: Implement rigorous parsing and type-checking routines in the extraction module.
- **Rule Verification Testing**: Develop unit tests to ensure exclusion filters work correctly.
- **Regular Progress Reviews**: Schedule checkpoints (e.g., November 15) to assess module readiness and coordinate integration.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Optimize file I/O routines and comment code for easier refactoring later if data volumes rise.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 3. Resource Requirements and Constraints

### Resource Requirements
- **Existing Assets**: Use current HR CSV/JSON files and local workstations.
- **Programming Environment**: Python 3.x, supporting libraries (pandas, ReportLab/matplotlib, PyYAML/Markdown).
- **Version Control**: GitHub for source control.
- **Team Roles**:
  - Project Lead: Oversees progress and coordination.
  - Data Specialist: Implements extraction, filtering, and validation logic.
  - Documentation Specialist: Maintains detailed methodology and usage docs.

### Constraints
- No usage of external APIs, cloud storage, enterprise servers, or microservices.
- Strict adherence to data privacy and exclusion rules.
- Designed for small-scale data processing within local environments.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. Test Coverage Plan

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Each module’s function will have dedicated tests covering edge cases and error handling (e.g., invalid file formats, missing fields).
- **Integration Testing**: Validate end-to-end workflows from data extraction through report generation.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure that updates do not break existing functionalities.

### Key Test Scenarios
- Validate that CSV/JSON files are correctly parsed into structured records.
- Ensure filtering functions remove contractors and founder’s family members.
- Verify that the tenure evaluator only includes employees with ≥10 years.
- Confirm that the generated PDF report and Markdown documentation are non-empty and correctly formatted.

Sample unit test for tenure qualification:
```python
def test_check_tenure_qualification():
    test_records = [
        {"employee_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "tenure": 12, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"},
        {"employee_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "tenure": 8, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"}
    ]
    qualified = check_tenure_qualification(test_records, min_years=10)
    assert len(qualified) == 1
    assert qualified[0]["name"] == "Alice"
```

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Integration Specifications

- **Interfaces**: Each module exposes functions that allow chaining outputs directly into the next module.
- **Module Dependencies**: 
  - The output of the Data Extraction Module feeds into the Data Validation & Filtering Module.
  - Validated data is passed sequentially to the Qualification Rule Engine.
  - Outputs from the rule engine feed both the Report Generation and Documentation Modules.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Consistent error logging via a dedicated Logger ensures traceability.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Performance Requirements

- **Small-Scale Data**: Optimized for local processing of HR records in the range of a few hundred employees.
- **Modular Efficiency**: Code modules are designed to be lightweight and fast in execution. Any performance bottlenecks (e.g., file I/O operations) will be addressed during integration testing.
- **Future Scalability**: Although designed for small-scale use (no enterprise architecture), the modular design allows for future refactoring if data volumes increase.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Implementation Timeline and Phases

| Phase                              | Timeline                | Key Deliverables                          |

  A[Input: Employee Records (CSV/JSON)]
  B[Data Extraction Module]
  C[Data Validation Module]
  D[Exclusion Filter (Contractors, Founder’s Family)]
  E[Qualification Check (≥10 Years)]
  F[Data Aggregation]
  G[Report Generation]
  H[Output: Validated Report & Methodology Documentation]
  
  A --> B
  B --> C
  C --> D
  D --> E
  E --> F
  F --> G
  G --> H
```

**Data Flow Details:**
- Employee records are ingested from CSV/JSON sources.
- The extraction module parses and cleans the data.
- Validation rules are applied to ensure data integrity.
- Filters exclude records that do not meet the criteria.
- Aggregation compiles the final list of qualified employees.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. API Specifications

Even though no external APIs or server endpoints are required for this small-scale project, an internal (local) interface specification is defined for potential expansion:

- **Function:** extract_employee_data(filepath: str) → DataFrame  
  - **Description:** Reads employee records from a CSV or JSON file and returns a structured DataFrame.
  
- **Function:** validate_and_filter_data(data: DataFrame) → DataFrame  
  - **Description:** Applies validation checks and exclusion filters (e.g., contractors, founder’s family).
  
- **Function:** check_tenure_qualification(data: DataFrame, years: int=10) → List[str]  
  - **Description:** Returns a list of employee names that meet or exceed the specified tenure.
  
- **Function:** generate_report(qualified_employees: List[str], output_path: str) → None  
  - **Description:** Generates a PDF report of the qualified employees along with execution details.
  
- **Function:** generate_documentation(details: dict, output_path: str) → None  
  - **Description:** Produces Markdown documentation of the methodology, criteria, and process steps.

These functions will serve as the internal API for our script which can be later integrated or expanded if needed.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Security Architecture

**Security Considerations:**
- **Data Privacy:**  
  - Process only locally stored HR records in CSV/JSON format.

**Scalability Measures:**
- **Modular Architecture:**  
  - Each component (extraction, validation, filtering, reporting) is modular.  
  - Modules can be enhanced or replaced independently as new requirements emerge.
  
- **Future Expansion:**  
  - While the current project uses local files and basic scripting, the design supports future refactoring toward a more service-oriented architecture if APIs or cloud-based processing become necessary.
  
- **Resource Efficiency:**  
  - The implementation is optimized for small data sets but is designed such that switching to batch processing would be straightforward in the future.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Deployment Architecture

**Deployment Considerations:**
- **Local Deployment:**  
  - The project runs from a local workstation or designated development machine.
  - All processing remains on-premises without reliance on external servers.

    Args:
      filepath: Path to the input file.
    Returns:
      List of employee records (dictionaries).
    """
    # implementation here
    pass

def validate_and_filter_data(data: list) -> list:
    """
    Validates employee record structure and applies exclusion rules.
    
    Args:
      data: List of employee records.
    Returns:
      Filtered list of employee records.
    """
    # implementation here
    pass

def check_tenure_qualification(data: list, min_years: int = 10) -> list:
    """
    Checks each record and determines if the employee has a tenure >= min_years.
    
    Args:
      data: List of filtered employee records.
      min_years: The minimum years of tenure.
    Returns:
      List of qualified employee records.
    """
    # implementation here
    pass

def generate_report(qualified_employees: list, output_path: str) -> None:

    """
    # implementation here
    pass
```

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. Data Models and Schemas

### Employee Record Schema
```json
{
  "employee_id": "string or integer",
  "name": "string",
  "tenure": "float or integer (years)",
  "employment_status": "string (e.g., full-time, contractor)",
  "relation_to_founder": "boolean or string (yes/no)"
}
```

### Validation Criteria:
- Tenure must be numeric and greater than or equal to 10.
- employment_status should not equal "contractor".
- relation_to_founder should be False or "no".

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Testing Strategy per Module

### Testing Approach:
- **Unit Tests:** Test each function individually with different edge cases (e.g., missing fields, incorrect data types).
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure data flows correctly between modules, e.g., data output from extractor feeds correctly into the validator.
- **Regression Tests:** Validate that future code changes do not break established functionality.

### Key Test Scenarios:
- Valid CSV/JSON input produces a correct list of employee records.
- Incorrect file format or missing records trigger expected validation errors.
- Exclusion filters correctly remove contractors and founder’s family.
- Tenure evaluation correctly identifies employees with ≥10 years.
- Report generation creates a non-empty PDF and correct markdown documentation.

### Sample Unit Test (using pytest)
```python
def test_check_tenure_qualification():
    test_records = [
        {"employee_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "tenure": 12, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"},
        {"employee_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "tenure": 8, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"}
    ]
    qualified = check_tenure_qualification(test_records, min_years=10)
    assert len(qualified) == 1
    assert qualified[0]["name"] == "Alice"
```

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Implementation Priorities and Sequence

### Priority Order:
1. **Data Extraction Module**
   - Implement file reading functions (CSV/JSON) with error handling.
2. **Data Validation & Filtering Module**
   - Define and implement data format checking and exclusion rules.
3. **Tenure Evaluation (Qualification Rule Engine)**
   - Code the function to check tenure criteria.
4. **Report Generation Module**
   - Create PDF generation and Markdown documentation functions.
5. **Integration Testing**
   - Combine modules and run through full end-to-end tests.
6. **Documentation and Code Review**
   - Update docs based on code modifiers and iterate based on team feedback.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Technical Debt Considerations

- **Short-Term Simplicity:**  
  - Use basic Python libraries; however, note that repeated parsing of large CSV/JSON files may need optimization.
- **Refactoring Possibilities:**  
  - As complexity grows, consider refactoring into separate classes for data I/O and business logic.
- **Testing Framework Expansion:**  
  - Initially use pytest, but potential to integrate Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines (like GitHub Actions) for regular testing.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Ensure inline comments are maintained. Code readability should be preserved as additional features are added.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Centralize error logging and handling mechanisms to reduce duplicate code in each module.

## 1. Complete Technical Architecture

### System Overview
The Senior Employee Identification System is a lightweight, local solution that extracts HR data from CSV/JSON files, validates and filters out records (excluding contractors and founder’s family), evaluates tenure criteria, and generates a validated PDF report along with supplementary Markdown documentation. The design emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and adherence to data privacy requirements.

### Module Breakdown & Components
| Module                            | Role                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Extraction Module            | Read and parse employee records from CSV/JSON files.                 |
| Data Validation & Filtering Module| Validate record structure and apply exclusion rules.                 |
| Qualification Rule Engine         | Check if each record meets the 10+ years tenure criteria.            |
| Report Generation Module          | Generate a PDF report and create Markdown documentation.             |
| Methodology Documentation Module  | Capture and archive decision logs and processing criteria.           |

### Data Flow Diagram (Mermaid Syntax)

  C --> D[Qualification Rule Engine]
  D --> E[Report Generation Module]
  D --> F[Methodology Documentation Module]
  E --> G[Final Validated Report (PDF)]
  F --> H[Documentation Archive (Markdown)]
```

### Integration & Interface Contracts
- Interfaces are defined as simple Python functions:
  - extract_employee_data(filepath) → list
  - validate_and_filter_data(data) → list
  - check_tenure_qualification(data, min_years=10) → list
  - generate_report(qualified_employees, output_path) → None
  - generate_documentation(details, output_path) → None

These interfaces support integration within a local, file-based workflow and enable each module to operate and be independently testable.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 2. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Identified Risks
- **Data Inaccuracy**: Input files may contain corrupted or unexpected formats.
- **Exclusion Rule Misapplication**: Risk of incorrectly including contractors or family members.
- **Project Delays**: Dependencies between sequential module development can introduce risks.
- **Performance Issues**: Repeated parsing of files may lead to delays if data volume increases.

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Data Validation Checks**: Implement rigorous parsing and type-checking routines in the extraction module.
- **Rule Verification Testing**: Develop unit tests to ensure exclusion filters work correctly.
- **Regular Progress Reviews**: Schedule checkpoints (e.g., November 15) to assess module readiness and coordinate integration.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Optimize file I/O routines and comment code for easier refactoring later if data volumes rise.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 3. Resource Requirements and Constraints

### Resource Requirements
- **Existing Assets**: Use current HR CSV/JSON files and local workstations.
- **Programming Environment**: Python 3.x, supporting libraries (pandas, ReportLab/matplotlib, PyYAML/Markdown).
- **Version Control**: GitHub for source control.
- **Team Roles**:
  - Project Lead: Oversees progress and coordination.
  - Data Specialist: Implements extraction, filtering, and validation logic.
  - Documentation Specialist: Maintains detailed methodology and usage docs.

### Constraints
- No usage of external APIs, cloud storage, enterprise servers, or microservices.
- Strict adherence to data privacy and exclusion rules.
- Designed for small-scale data processing within local environments.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. Test Coverage Plan

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Each module’s function will have dedicated tests covering edge cases and error handling (e.g., invalid file formats, missing fields).
- **Integration Testing**: Validate end-to-end workflows from data extraction through report generation.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure that updates do not break existing functionalities.

### Key Test Scenarios
- Validate that CSV/JSON files are correctly parsed into structured records.
- Ensure filtering functions remove contractors and founder’s family members.
- Verify that the tenure evaluator only includes employees with ≥10 years.
- Confirm that the generated PDF report and Markdown documentation are non-empty and correctly formatted.

Sample unit test for tenure qualification:
```python
def test_check_tenure_qualification():
    test_records = [
        {"employee_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "tenure": 12, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"},
        {"employee_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "tenure": 8, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"}
    ]
    qualified = check_tenure_qualification(test_records, min_years=10)
    assert len(qualified) == 1
    assert qualified[0]["name"] == "Alice"
```

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Integration Specifications

- **Interfaces**: Each module exposes functions that allow chaining outputs directly into the next module.
- **Module Dependencies**: 
  - The output of the Data Extraction Module feeds into the Data Validation & Filtering Module.
  - Validated data is passed sequentially to the Qualification Rule Engine.
  - Outputs from the rule engine feed both the Report Generation and Documentation Modules.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Consistent error logging via a dedicated Logger ensures traceability.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Performance Requirements

- **Small-Scale Data**: Optimized for local processing of HR records in the range of a few hundred employees.
- **Modular Efficiency**: Code modules are designed to be lightweight and fast in execution. Any performance bottlenecks (e.g., file I/O operations) will be addressed during integration testing.
- **Future Scalability**: Although designed for small-scale use (no enterprise architecture), the modular design allows for future refactoring if data volumes increase.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Implementation Timeline and Phases

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. API Specifications

Even though no external APIs or server endpoints are required for this small-scale project, an internal (local) interface specification is defined for potential expansion:

- **Function:** extract_employee_data(filepath: str) → DataFrame  
  - **Description:** Reads employee records from a CSV or JSON file and returns a structured DataFrame.
  
- **Function:** validate_and_filter_data(data: DataFrame) → DataFrame  
  - **Description:** Applies validation checks and exclusion filters (e.g., contractors, founder’s family).
  
- **Function:** check_tenure_qualification(data: DataFrame, years: int=10) → List[str]  
  - **Description:** Returns a list of employee names that meet or exceed the specified tenure.
  
- **Function:** generate_report(qualified_employees: List[str], output_path: str) → None  
  - **Description:** Generates a PDF report of the qualified employees along with execution details.
  
- **Function:** generate_documentation(details: dict, output_path: str) → None  
  - **Description:** Produces Markdown documentation of the methodology, criteria, and process steps.

These functions will serve as the internal API for our script which can be later integrated or expanded if needed.

## 4. Data Models and Schemas

### Employee Record Schema
```json
{
  "employee_id": "string or integer",
  "name": "string",
  "tenure": "float or integer (years)",
  "employment_status": "string (e.g., full-time, contractor)",
  "relation_to_founder": "boolean or string (yes/no)"
}
```

### Validation Criteria:
- Tenure must be numeric and greater than or equal to 10.
- employment_status should not equal "contractor".
- relation_to_founder should be False or "no".

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Testing Strategy per Module

### Testing Approach:
- **Unit Tests:** Test each function individually with different edge cases (e.g., missing fields, incorrect data types).
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure data flows correctly between modules, e.g., data output from extractor feeds correctly into the validator.
- **Regression Tests:** Validate that future code changes do not break established functionality.

### Key Test Scenarios:
- Valid CSV/JSON input produces a correct list of employee records.
- Incorrect file format or missing records trigger expected validation errors.
- Exclusion filters correctly remove contractors and founder’s family.
- Tenure evaluation correctly identifies employees with ≥10 years.
- Report generation creates a non-empty PDF and correct markdown documentation.

### Sample Unit Test (using pytest)
```python
def test_check_tenure_qualification():
    test_records = [
        {"employee_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "tenure": 12, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"},
        {"employee_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "tenure": 8, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"}
    ]
    qualified = check_tenure_qualification(test_records, min_years=10)
    assert len(qualified) == 1
    assert qualified[0]["name"] == "Alice"
```

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Implementation Priorities and Sequence

### Priority Order:
1. **Data Extraction Module**
   - Implement file reading functions (CSV/JSON) with error handling.
2. **Data Validation & Filtering Module**
   - Define and implement data format checking and exclusion rules.
3. **Tenure Evaluation (Qualification Rule Engine)**
   - Code the function to check tenure criteria.
4. **Report Generation Module**
   - Create PDF generation and Markdown documentation functions.
5. **Integration Testing**
   - Combine modules and run through full end-to-end tests.
6. **Documentation and Code Review**
   - Update docs based on code modifiers and iterate based on team feedback.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Technical Debt Considerations

- **Short-Term Simplicity:**  
  - Use basic Python libraries; however, note that repeated parsing of large CSV/JSON files may need optimization.
- **Refactoring Possibilities:**  
  - As complexity grows, consider refactoring into separate classes for data I/O and business logic.
- **Testing Framework Expansion:**  
  - Initially use pytest, but potential to integrate Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines (like GitHub Actions) for regular testing.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Ensure inline comments are maintained. Code readability should be preserved as additional features are added.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Centralize error logging and handling mechanisms to reduce duplicate code in each module.

# code_technical_design.md

## 1. Complete Technical Architecture

### System Overview
The Senior Employee Identification System is a lightweight, local solution that extracts HR data from CSV/JSON files, validates and filters out records (excluding contractors and founder’s family), evaluates tenure criteria, and generates a validated PDF report along with supplementary Markdown documentation. The design emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and adherence to data privacy requirements.

### Module Breakdown & Components
| Module                            | Role                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Extraction Module            | Read and parse employee records from CSV/JSON files.                 |
| Data Validation & Filtering Module| Validate record structure and apply exclusion rules.                 |
| Qualification Rule Engine         | Check if each record meets the 10+ years tenure criteria.            |
| Report Generation Module          | Generate a PDF report and create Markdown documentation.             |
| Methodology Documentation Module  | Capture and archive decision logs and processing criteria.           |

### Data Flow Diagram (Mermaid Syntax)

  C --> D[Qualification Rule Engine]
  D --> E[Report Generation Module]
  D --> F[Methodology Documentation Module]
  E --> G[Final Validated Report (PDF)]
  F --> H[Documentation Archive (Markdown)]
```

### Integration & Interface Contracts
- Interfaces are defined as simple Python functions:
  - extract_employee_data(filepath) → list
  - validate_and_filter_data(data) → list
  - check_tenure_qualification(data, min_years=10) → list
  - generate_report(qualified_employees, output_path) → None
  - generate_documentation(details, output_path) → None

These interfaces support integration within a local, file-based workflow and enable each module to operate and be independently testable.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 2. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Identified Risks
- **Data Inaccuracy**: Input files may contain corrupted or unexpected formats.
- **Exclusion Rule Misapplication**: Risk of incorrectly including contractors or family members.
- **Project Delays**: Dependencies between sequential module development can introduce risks.
- **Performance Issues**: Repeated parsing of files may lead to delays if data volume increases.

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Data Validation Checks**: Implement rigorous parsing and type-checking routines in the extraction module.
- **Rule Verification Testing**: Develop unit tests to ensure exclusion filters work correctly.
- **Regular Progress Reviews**: Schedule checkpoints (e.g., November 15) to assess module readiness and coordinate integration.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Optimize file I/O routines and comment code for easier refactoring later if data volumes rise.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 3. Resource Requirements and Constraints

### Resource Requirements
- **Existing Assets**: Use current HR CSV/JSON files and local workstations.
- **Programming Environment**: Python 3.x, supporting libraries (pandas, ReportLab/matplotlib, PyYAML/Markdown).
- **Version Control**: GitHub for source control.
- **Team Roles**:
  - Project Lead: Oversees progress and coordination.
  - Data Specialist: Implements extraction, filtering, and validation logic.
  - Documentation Specialist: Maintains detailed methodology and usage docs.

### Constraints
- No usage of external APIs, cloud storage, enterprise servers, or microservices.
- Strict adherence to data privacy and exclusion rules.
- Designed for small-scale data processing within local environments.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. Test Coverage Plan

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Each module’s function will have dedicated tests covering edge cases and error handling (e.g., invalid file formats, missing fields).
- **Integration Testing**: Validate end-to-end workflows from data extraction through report generation.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure that updates do not break existing functionalities.

### Key Test Scenarios
- Validate that CSV/JSON files are correctly parsed into structured records.
- Ensure filtering functions remove contractors and founder’s family members.
- Verify that the tenure evaluator only includes employees with ≥10 years.
- Confirm that the generated PDF report and Markdown documentation are non-empty and correctly formatted.

Sample unit test for tenure qualification:
```python
def test_check_tenure_qualification():
    test_records = [
        {"employee_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "tenure": 12, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"},
        {"employee_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "tenure": 8, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"}
    ]
    qualified = check_tenure_qualification(test_records, min_years=10)
    assert len(qualified) == 1
    assert qualified[0]["name"] == "Alice"
```

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Integration Specifications

- **Interfaces**: Each module exposes functions that allow chaining outputs directly into the next module.
- **Module Dependencies**: 
  - The output of the Data Extraction Module feeds into the Data Validation & Filtering Module.
  - Validated data is passed sequentially to the Qualification Rule Engine.
  - Outputs from the rule engine feed both the Report Generation and Documentation Modules.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Consistent error logging via a dedicated Logger ensures traceability.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Performance Requirements

- **Small-Scale Data**: Optimized for local processing of HR records in the range of a few hundred employees.
- **Modular Efficiency**: Code modules are designed to be lightweight and fast in execution. Any performance bottlenecks (e.g., file I/O operations) will be addressed during integration testing.
- **Future Scalability**: Although designed for small-scale use (no enterprise architecture), the modular design allows for future refactoring if data volumes increase.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Implementation Timeline and Phases

| Phase                              | Timeline                | Key Deliverables                          |

- **Qualification Rule Engine:** Determines if employees meet the ≥10 years tenure requirement.
- **Report Generation Module:** Generates a PDF report listing at least three qualified, senior employees.
- **Methodology Documentation Generator:** Prepares the supporting documentation (in Markdown) for process traceability.
- **Documentation Archive:** Stores all final documents and relevant logs.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 2. Technology Stack Details

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x  
  - Chosen for its simplicity in scripting, data processing, and generating reports.
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**  
  - pandas – For CSV/JSON parsing and data manipulation.
  - matplotlib or ReportLab – For generating PDF reports (if graphical output is needed).
  - PyYAML/Markdown – For documentation creation and formatting.
- **Version Control:** Git (hosted on GitHub)  
  - Ensures traceability and collaboration.
- **Automation Tool:** AutoCoder  
  - Used for workflow triggers and ensuring adherence to development standards.
- **Local Environment:**  
  - No enterprise infrastructure; all processing is done on local machines or designated workstations.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 3. Data Flow Diagram

The following diagram details the data flow from input to output, ensuring validation and security.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Input: Employee Records (CSV/JSON)]
  B[Data Extraction Module]
  C[Data Validation Module]
  D[Exclusion Filter (Contractors, Founder’s Family)]
  E[Qualification Check (≥10 Years)]
  F[Data Aggregation]
  G[Report Generation]
  H[Output: Validated Report & Methodology Documentation]
  
  A --> B
  B --> C
  C --> D
  D --> E
  E --> F
  F --> G
  G --> H
```

**Data Flow Details:**
- Employee records are ingested from CSV/JSON sources.
- The extraction module parses and cleans the data.
- Validation rules are applied to ensure data integrity.
- Filters exclude records that do not meet the criteria.
- Aggregation compiles the final list of qualified employees.
- The report generation module produces the final deliverables.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. API Specifications

Even though no external APIs or server endpoints are required for this small-scale project, an internal (local) interface specification is defined for potential expansion:

- **Function:** extract_employee_data(filepath: str) → DataFrame  
  - **Description:** Reads employee records from a CSV or JSON file and returns a structured DataFrame.
  
- **Function:** validate_and_filter_data(data: DataFrame) → DataFrame  
  - **Description:** Applies validation checks and exclusion filters (e.g., contractors, founder’s family).
  
- **Function:** check_tenure_qualification(data: DataFrame, years: int=10) → List[str]  
  - **Description:** Returns a list of employee names that meet or exceed the specified tenure.
  
- **Function:** generate_report(qualified_employees: List[str], output_path: str) → None  
  - **Description:** Generates a PDF report of the qualified employees along with execution details.
  
- **Function:** generate_documentation(details: dict, output_path: str) → None  
  - **Description:** Produces Markdown documentation of the methodology, criteria, and process steps.

These functions will serve as the internal API for our script which can be later integrated or expanded if needed.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Security Architecture

**Security Considerations:**
- **Data Privacy:**  
  - Process only locally stored HR records in CSV/JSON format.
  - Ensure that personal identifiers are handled following internal data privacy guidelines.
  
- **Access Controls:**  
  - The script runs on designated secure workstations with restricted access.
  - Documentation is stored in a controlled GitHub repository.
  
- **Audit Trail:**  
  - Maintain logs for data extraction, validation steps, and modifications for traceability.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  - The system is designed to catch and log errors, ensuring that all anomalies are documented for review.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Scalability Design

**Scalability Measures:**
- **Modular Architecture:**  
  - Each component (extraction, validation, filtering, reporting) is modular.  
  - Modules can be enhanced or replaced independently as new requirements emerge.
  
- **Future Expansion:**  
  - While the current project uses local files and basic scripting, the design supports future refactoring toward a more service-oriented architecture if APIs or cloud-based processing become necessary.
  
- **Resource Efficiency:**  
  - The implementation is optimized for small data sets but is designed such that switching to batch processing would be straightforward in the future.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Deployment Architecture

**Deployment Considerations:**
- **Local Deployment:**  
  - The project runs from a local workstation or designated development machine.
  - All processing remains on-premises without reliance on external servers.

```

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. Data Models and Schemas

### Employee Record Schema
```json
{
  "employee_id": "string or integer",
  "name": "string",
  "tenure": "float or integer (years)",
  "employment_status": "string (e.g., full-time, contractor)",
  "relation_to_founder": "boolean or string (yes/no)"
}
```

### Validation Criteria:
- Tenure must be numeric and greater than or equal to 10.
- employment_status should not equal "contractor".
- relation_to_founder should be False or "no".

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Testing Strategy per Module

### Testing Approach:
- **Unit Tests:** Test each function individually with different edge cases (e.g., missing fields, incorrect data types).
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure data flows correctly between modules, e.g., data output from extractor feeds correctly into the validator.
- **Regression Tests:** Validate that future code changes do not break established functionality.

### Key Test Scenarios:
- Valid CSV/JSON input produces a correct list of employee records.
- Incorrect file format or missing records trigger expected validation errors.
- Exclusion filters correctly remove contractors and founder’s family.
- Tenure evaluation correctly identifies employees with ≥10 years.
- Report generation creates a non-empty PDF and correct markdown documentation.

### Sample Unit Test (using pytest)
```python
def test_check_tenure_qualification():
    test_records = [
        {"employee_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "tenure": 12, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"},
        {"employee_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "tenure": 8, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"}
    ]
    qualified = check_tenure_qualification(test_records, min_years=10)
    assert len(qualified) == 1
    assert qualified[0]["name"] == "Alice"
```

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Implementation Priorities and Sequence

### Priority Order:
1. **Data Extraction Module**
   - Implement file reading functions (CSV/JSON) with error handling.
2. **Data Validation & Filtering Module**
   - Define and implement data format checking and exclusion rules.
3. **Tenure Evaluation (Qualification Rule Engine)**
   - Code the function to check tenure criteria.
4. **Report Generation Module**
   - Create PDF generation and Markdown documentation functions.
5. **Integration Testing**
   - Combine modules and run through full end-to-end tests.
6. **Documentation and Code Review**
   - Update docs based on code modifiers and iterate based on team feedback.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Technical Debt Considerations

- **Short-Term Simplicity:**  
  - Use basic Python libraries; however, note that repeated parsing of large CSV/JSON files may need optimization.
- **Refactoring Possibilities:**  
  - As complexity grows, consider refactoring into separate classes for data I/O and business logic.
- **Testing Framework Expansion:**  
  - Initially use pytest, but potential to integrate Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines (like GitHub Actions) for regular testing.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Ensure inline comments are maintained. Code readability should be preserved as additional features are added.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Centralize error logging and handling mechanisms to reduce duplicate code in each module.

# code_technical_design.md

## 1. Complete Technical Architecture

### System Overview
The Senior Employee Identification System is a lightweight, local solution that extracts HR data from CSV/JSON files, validates and filters out records (excluding contractors and founder’s family), evaluates tenure criteria, and generates a validated PDF report along with supplementary Markdown documentation. The design emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and adherence to data privacy requirements.

### Module Breakdown & Components
| Module                            | Role                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Extraction Module            | Read and parse employee records from CSV/JSON files.                 |
| Data Validation & Filtering Module| Validate record structure and apply exclusion rules.                 |
| Qualification Rule Engine         | Check if each record meets the 10+ years tenure criteria.            |
| Report Generation Module          | Generate a PDF report and create Markdown documentation.             |
| Methodology Documentation Module  | Capture and archive decision logs and processing criteria.           |

### Data Flow Diagram (Mermaid Syntax)
```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[HR Database (CSV/JSON)]
  --> B[Data Extraction Module]
  B --> C[Data Validation & Filtering Module]
  C --> D[Qualification Rule Engine]
  D --> E[Report Generation Module]
  D --> F[Methodology Documentation Module]
  E --> G[Final Validated Report (PDF)]
  F --> H[Documentation Archive (Markdown)]
```

### Integration & Interface Contracts
- Interfaces are defined as simple Python functions:
  - extract_employee_data(filepath) → list
  - validate_and_filter_data(data) → list
  - check_tenure_qualification(data, min_years=10) → list
  - generate_report(qualified_employees, output_path) → None
  - generate_documentation(details, output_path) → None

These interfaces support integration within a local, file-based workflow and enable each module to operate and be independently testable.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 2. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Identified Risks
- **Data Inaccuracy**: Input files may contain corrupted or unexpected formats.
- **Exclusion Rule Misapplication**: Risk of incorrectly including contractors or family members.
- **Project Delays**: Dependencies between sequential module development can introduce risks.
- **Performance Issues**: Repeated parsing of files may lead to delays if data volume increases.

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Data Validation Checks**: Implement rigorous parsing and type-checking routines in the extraction module.
- **Rule Verification Testing**: Develop unit tests to ensure exclusion filters work correctly.
- **Regular Progress Reviews**: Schedule checkpoints (e.g., November 15) to assess module readiness and coordinate integration.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Optimize file I/O routines and comment code for easier refactoring later if data volumes rise.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 3. Resource Requirements and Constraints

### Resource Requirements
- **Existing Assets**: Use current HR CSV/JSON files and local workstations.
- **Programming Environment**: Python 3.x, supporting libraries (pandas, ReportLab/matplotlib, PyYAML/Markdown).
- **Version Control**: GitHub for source control.
- **Team Roles**:
  - Project Lead: Oversees progress and coordination.
  - Data Specialist: Implements extraction, filtering, and validation logic.
  - Documentation Specialist: Maintains detailed methodology and usage docs.

### Constraints
- No usage of external APIs, cloud storage, enterprise servers, or microservices.
- Strict adherence to data privacy and exclusion rules.
- Designed for small-scale data processing within local environments.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. Test Coverage Plan

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Each module’s function will have dedicated tests covering edge cases and error handling (e.g., invalid file formats, missing fields).
- **Integration Testing**: Validate end-to-end workflows from data extraction through report generation.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure that updates do not break existing functionalities.

### Key Test Scenarios
- Validate that CSV/JSON files are correctly parsed into structured records.
- Ensure filtering functions remove contractors and founder’s family members.
- Verify that the tenure evaluator only includes employees with ≥10 years.
- Confirm that the generated PDF report and Markdown documentation are non-empty and correctly formatted.

Sample unit test for tenure qualification:
```python
def test_check_tenure_qualification():
    test_records = [
        {"employee_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "tenure": 12, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"},
        {"employee_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "tenure": 8, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"}
    ]
    qualified = check_tenure_qualification(test_records, min_years=10)
    assert len(qualified) == 1
    assert qualified[0]["name"] == "Alice"
```

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Integration Specifications

- **Interfaces**: Each module exposes functions that allow chaining outputs directly into the next module.
- **Module Dependencies**: 
  - The output of the Data Extraction Module feeds into the Data Validation & Filtering Module.
  - Validated data is passed sequentially to the Qualification Rule Engine.
  - Outputs from the rule engine feed both the Report Generation and Documentation Modules.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Consistent error logging via a dedicated Logger ensures traceability.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Performance Requirements

- **Small-Scale Data**: Optimized for local processing of HR records in the range of a few hundred employees.
- **Modular Efficiency**: Code modules are designed to be lightweight and fast in execution. Any performance bottlenecks (e.g., file I/O operations) will be addressed during integration testing.
- **Future Scalability**: Although designed for small-scale use (no enterprise architecture), the modular design allows for future refactoring if data volumes increase.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Implementation Timeline and Phases

| Phase                              | Timeline                | Key Deliverables                          |

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. Data Models and Schemas

### Employee Record Schema
```json
{
  "employee_id": "string or integer",
  "name": "string",
  "tenure": "float or integer (years)",
  "employment_status": "string (e.g., full-time, contractor)",
  "relation_to_founder": "boolean or string (yes/no)"
}
```

### Validation Criteria:
- Tenure must be numeric and greater than or equal to 10.
- employment_status should not equal "contractor".
- relation_to_founder should be False or "no".

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Testing Strategy per Module

### Testing Approach:
- **Unit Tests:** Test each function individually with different edge cases (e.g., missing fields, incorrect data types).
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure data flows correctly between modules, e.g., data output from extractor feeds correctly into the validator.
- **Regression Tests:** Validate that future code changes do not break established functionality.

### Key Test Scenarios:
- Valid CSV/JSON input produces a correct list of employee records.
- Incorrect file format or missing records trigger expected validation errors.
- Exclusion filters correctly remove contractors and founder’s family.
- Tenure evaluation correctly identifies employees with ≥10 years.
- Report generation creates a non-empty PDF and correct markdown documentation.

### Sample Unit Test (using pytest)
```python
def test_check_tenure_qualification():
    test_records = [
        {"employee_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "tenure": 12, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"},
        {"employee_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "tenure": 8, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"}
    ]
    qualified = check_tenure_qualification(test_records, min_years=10)
    assert len(qualified) == 1
    assert qualified[0]["name"] == "Alice"
```

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Implementation Priorities and Sequence

### Priority Order:
1. **Data Extraction Module**
   - Implement file reading functions (CSV/JSON) with error handling.
2. **Data Validation & Filtering Module**
   - Define and implement data format checking and exclusion rules.
3. **Tenure Evaluation (Qualification Rule Engine)**
   - Code the function to check tenure criteria.

## 1. Complete Technical Architecture

### System Overview
The Senior Employee Identification System is a lightweight, local solution that extracts HR data from CSV/JSON files, validates and filters out records (excluding contractors and founder’s family), evaluates tenure criteria, and generates a validated PDF report along with supplementary Markdown documentation. The design emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and adherence to data privacy requirements.

### Module Breakdown & Components
| Module                            | Role                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Extraction Module            | Read and parse employee records from CSV/JSON files.                 |
| Data Validation & Filtering Module| Validate record structure and apply exclusion rules.                 |
| Qualification Rule Engine         | Check if each record meets the 10+ years tenure criteria.            |
| Report Generation Module          | Generate a PDF report and create Markdown documentation.             |
| Methodology Documentation Module  | Capture and archive decision logs and processing criteria.           |

### Data Flow Diagram (Mermaid Syntax)

  C --> D[Qualification Rule Engine]
  D --> E[Report Generation Module]
  D --> F[Methodology Documentation Module]
  E --> G[Final Validated Report (PDF)]
  F --> H[Documentation Archive (Markdown)]
```

### Integration & Interface Contracts
- Interfaces are defined as simple Python functions:
  - extract_employee_data(filepath) → list
  - validate_and_filter_data(data) → list
  - check_tenure_qualification(data, min_years=10) → list
  - generate_report(qualified_employees, output_path) → None
  - generate_documentation(details, output_path) → None

These interfaces support integration within a local, file-based workflow and enable each module to operate and be independently testable.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 2. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Identified Risks
- **Data Inaccuracy**: Input files may contain corrupted or unexpected formats.
- **Exclusion Rule Misapplication**: Risk of incorrectly including contractors or family members.
- **Project Delays**: Dependencies between sequential module development can introduce risks.
- **Performance Issues**: Repeated parsing of files may lead to delays if data volume increases.

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Data Validation Checks**: Implement rigorous parsing and type-checking routines in the extraction module.
- **Rule Verification Testing**: Develop unit tests to ensure exclusion filters work correctly.
- **Regular Progress Reviews**: Schedule checkpoints (e.g., November 15) to assess module readiness and coordinate integration.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Optimize file I/O routines and comment code for easier refactoring later if data volumes rise.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 3. Resource Requirements and Constraints

### Resource Requirements
- **Existing Assets**: Use current HR CSV/JSON files and local workstations.

- **Version Control**: GitHub for source control.
- **Team Roles**:
  - Project Lead: Oversees progress and coordination.
  - Data Specialist: Implements extraction, filtering, and validation logic.
  - Documentation Specialist: Maintains detailed methodology and usage docs.

### Constraints
- No usage of external APIs, cloud storage, enterprise servers, or microservices.
- Strict adherence to data privacy and exclusion rules.
- Designed for small-scale data processing within local environments.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. Test Coverage Plan

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Each module’s function will have dedicated tests covering edge cases and error handling (e.g., invalid file formats, missing fields).
- **Integration Testing**: Validate end-to-end workflows from data extraction through report generation.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure that updates do not break existing functionalities.

### Key Test Scenarios
- Validate that CSV/JSON files are correctly parsed into structured records.
- Ensure filtering functions remove contractors and founder’s family members.
- Verify that the tenure evaluator only includes employees with ≥10 years.
- Confirm that the generated PDF report and Markdown documentation are non-empty and correctly formatted.

Sample unit test for tenure qualification:
```python
def test_check_tenure_qualification():
    test_records = [
        {"employee_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "tenure": 12, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"},
        {"employee_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "tenure": 8, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"}
    ]
    qualified = check_tenure_qualification(test_records, min_years=10)
    assert len(qualified) == 1
    assert qualified[0]["name"] == "Alice"
```

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Integration Specifications

- **Interfaces**: Each module exposes functions that allow chaining outputs directly into the next module.
- **Module Dependencies**: 
  - The output of the Data Extraction Module feeds into the Data Validation & Filtering Module.
  - Validated data is passed sequentially to the Qualification Rule Engine.
  - Outputs from the rule engine feed both the Report Generation and Documentation Modules.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Consistent error logging via a dedicated Logger ensures traceability.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Performance Requirements

- **Small-Scale Data**: Optimized for local processing of HR records in the range of a few hundred employees.
- **Modular Efficiency**: Code modules are designed to be lightweight and fast in execution. Any performance bottlenecks (e.g., file I/O operations) will be addressed during integration testing.
- **Future Scalability**: Although designed for small-scale use (no enterprise architecture), the modular design allows for future refactoring if data volumes increase.

- **Qualification Rule Engine:** Determines if employees meet the ≥10 years tenure requirement.
- **Report Generation Module:** Generates a PDF report listing at least three qualified, senior employees.
- **Methodology Documentation Generator:** Prepares the supporting documentation (in Markdown) for process traceability.
- **Documentation Archive:** Stores all final documents and relevant logs.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 2. Technology Stack Details

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x  
  - Chosen for its simplicity in scripting, data processing, and generating reports.
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**  
  - pandas – For CSV/JSON parsing and data manipulation.
  - matplotlib or ReportLab – For generating PDF reports (if graphical output is needed).
  - PyYAML/Markdown – For documentation creation and formatting.
- **Version Control:** Git (hosted on GitHub)  
  - Ensures traceability and collaboration.
- **Automation Tool:** AutoCoder  
  - Used for workflow triggers and ensuring adherence to development standards.
- **Local Environment:**

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 3. Data Flow Diagram

The following diagram details the data flow from input to output, ensuring validation and security.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Input: Employee Records (CSV/JSON)]
  B[Data Extraction Module]
  C[Data Validation Module]
  D[Exclusion Filter (Contractors, Founder’s Family)]
  E[Qualification Check (≥10 Years)]
  F[Data Aggregation]
  G[Report Generation]
  H[Output: Validated Report & Methodology Documentation]
  
  A --> B
  B --> C
  C --> D
  D --> E
  E --> F
  F --> G
  G --> H
```

**Data Flow Details:**
- Employee records are ingested from CSV/JSON sources.
- The extraction module parses and cleans the data.
- Validation rules are applied to ensure data integrity.
- Filters exclude records that do not meet the criteria.
- Aggregation compiles the final list of qualified employees.
- The report generation module produces the final deliverables.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. API Specifications

Even though no external APIs or server endpoints are required for this small-scale project, an internal (local) interface specification is defined for potential expansion:

- **Function:** extract_employee_data(filepath: str) → DataFrame  
  - **Description:** Reads employee records from a CSV or JSON file and returns a structured DataFrame.
  
- **Function:** validate_and_filter_data(data: DataFrame) → DataFrame  
  - **Description:** Applies validation checks and exclusion filters (e.g., contractors, founder’s family).
  
- **Function:** check_tenure_qualification(data: DataFrame, years: int=10) → List[str]  
  - **Description:** Returns a list of employee names that meet or exceed the specified tenure.
  
- **Function:** generate_report(qualified_employees: List[str], output_path: str) → None  
  - **Description:** Generates a PDF report of the qualified employees along with execution details.
  
- **Function:** generate_documentation(details: dict, output_path: str) → None  
  - **Description:** Produces Markdown documentation of the methodology, criteria, and process steps.

These functions will serve as the internal API for our script which can be later integrated or expanded if needed.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Security Architecture

**Security Considerations:**
- **Data Privacy:**  
  - Process only locally stored HR records in CSV/JSON format.
  - Ensure that personal identifiers are handled following internal data privacy guidelines.
  
- **Access Controls:**  
  - The script runs on designated secure workstations with restricted access.
  - Documentation is stored in a controlled GitHub repository.
  
- **Audit Trail:**  
  - Maintain logs for data extraction, validation steps, and modifications for traceability.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  - The system is designed to catch and log errors, ensuring that all anomalies are documented for review.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Scalability Design

**Scalability Measures:**
- **Modular Architecture:**  
  - Each component (extraction, validation, filtering, reporting) is modular.  
  - Modules can be enhanced or replaced independently as new requirements emerge.
  
- **Future Expansion:**  
  - While the current project uses local files and basic scripting, the design supports future refactoring toward a more service-oriented architecture if APIs or cloud-based processing become necessary.
  
- **Resource Efficiency:**  
  - The implementation is optimized for small data sets but is designed such that switching to batch processing would be straightforward in the future.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Deployment Architecture

**Deployment Considerations:**
- **Local Deployment:**  
  - The project runs from a local workstation or designated development machine.
  - All processing remains on-premises without reliance on external servers.
  
- **Version Control and CI:**  
  - Code is managed via GitHub with regular commits and reviews.
  - Automated tests (if introduced) will run locally via a simple CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to ensure integrity.
  
- **Reporting Delivery:**  
  - Final reports (PDF) and documentation are stored in the `/projects/senior_employee_identification/deliverables/` folder.
  - The final documentation is also archived in the project’s GitHub repository to maintain traceability.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## Meeting Closing Summary

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. Data Models and Schemas

### Employee Record Schema
```json
{
  "employee_id": "string or integer",
  "name": "string",
  "tenure": "float or integer (years)",
  "employment_status": "string (e.g., full-time, contractor)",
  "relation_to_founder": "boolean or string (yes/no)"
}
```

### Validation Criteria:
- Tenure must be numeric and greater than or equal to 10.
- employment_status should not equal "contractor".
- relation_to_founder should be False or "no".

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Testing Strategy per Module

### Testing Approach:
- **Unit Tests:** Test each function individually with different edge cases (e.g., missing fields, incorrect data types).
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure data flows correctly between modules, e.g., data output from extractor feeds correctly into the validator.
- **Regression Tests:** Validate that future code changes do not break established functionality.

### Key Test Scenarios:
- Valid CSV/JSON input produces a correct list of employee records.
- Incorrect file format or missing records trigger expected validation errors.
- Exclusion filters correctly remove contractors and founder’s family.
- Tenure evaluation correctly identifies employees with ≥10 years.
- Report generation creates a non-empty PDF and correct markdown documentation.

### Sample Unit Test (using pytest)
```python
def test_check_tenure_qualification():
    test_records = [
        {"employee_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "tenure": 12, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"},
        {"employee_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "tenure": 8, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"}
    ]
    qualified = check_tenure_qualification(test_records, min_years=10)
    assert len(qualified) == 1
    assert qualified[0]["name"] == "Alice"
```

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Implementation Priorities and Sequence

### Priority Order:
1. **Data Extraction Module**
   - Implement file reading functions (CSV/JSON) with error handling.
2. **Data Validation & Filtering Module**
   - Define and implement data format checking and exclusion rules.
3. **Tenure Evaluation (Qualification Rule Engine)**
   - Code the function to check tenure criteria.
4. **Report Generation Module**
   - Create PDF generation and Markdown documentation functions.
5. **Integration Testing**
   - Combine modules and run through full end-to-end tests.
6. **Documentation and Code Review**
   - Update docs based on code modifiers and iterate based on team feedback.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Technical Debt Considerations

- **Short-Term Simplicity:**  
  - Use basic Python libraries; however, note that repeated parsing of large CSV/JSON files may need optimization.
- **Refactoring Possibilities:**  
  - As complexity grows, consider refactoring into separate classes for data I/O and business logic.
- **Testing Framework Expansion:**  
  - Initially use pytest, but potential to integrate Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines (like GitHub Actions) for regular testing.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Ensure inline comments are maintained. Code readability should be preserved as additional features are added.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Centralize error logging and handling mechanisms to reduce duplicate code in each module.

# code_technical_design.md

## 1. Complete Technical Architecture

### System Overview
The Senior Employee Identification System is a lightweight, local solution that extracts HR data from CSV/JSON files, validates and filters out records (excluding contractors and founder’s family), evaluates tenure criteria, and generates a validated PDF report along with supplementary Markdown documentation. The design emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and adherence to data privacy requirements.

### Module Breakdown & Components
| Module                            | Role                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Extraction Module            | Read and parse employee records from CSV/JSON files.                 |
| Data Validation & Filtering Module| Validate record structure and apply exclusion rules.                 |
| Qualification Rule Engine         | Check if each record meets the 10+ years tenure criteria.            |
| Report Generation Module          | Generate a PDF report and create Markdown documentation.             |
| Methodology Documentation Module  | Capture and archive decision logs and processing criteria.           |

### Data Flow Diagram (Mermaid Syntax)
```mermaid

  A[HR Database (CSV/JSON)]
  --> B[Data Extraction Module]
  B --> C[Data Validation & Filtering Module]
  C --> D[Qualification Rule Engine]
  D --> E[Report Generation Module]
  D --> F[Methodology Documentation Module]
  E --> G[Final Validated Report (PDF)]
  F --> H[Documentation Archive (Markdown)]
```

### Integration & Interface Contracts
- Interfaces are defined as simple Python functions:
  - extract_employee_data(filepath) → list
  - validate_and_filter_data(data) → list
  - check_tenure_qualification(data, min_years=10) → list
  - generate_report(qualified_employees, output_path) → None
  - generate_documentation(details, output_path) → None

These interfaces support integration within a local, file-based workflow and enable each module to operate and be independently testable.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 2. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Identified Risks
- **Data Inaccuracy**: Input files may contain corrupted or unexpected formats.
- **Exclusion Rule Misapplication**: Risk of incorrectly including contractors or family members.
- **Project Delays**: Dependencies between sequential module development can introduce risks.
- **Performance Issues**: Repeated parsing of files may lead to delays if data volume increases.

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Data Validation Checks**: Implement rigorous parsing and type-checking routines in the extraction module.
- **Rule Verification Testing**: Develop unit tests to ensure exclusion filters work correctly.
- **Regular Progress Reviews**: Schedule checkpoints (e.g., November 15) to assess module readiness and coordinate integration.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Optimize file I/O routines and comment code for easier refactoring later if data volumes rise.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 3. Resource Requirements and Constraints

### Resource Requirements
- **Existing Assets**: Use current HR CSV/JSON files and local workstations.
- **Programming Environment**: Python 3.x, supporting libraries (pandas, ReportLab/matplotlib, PyYAML/Markdown).
- **Version Control**: GitHub for source control.
- **Team Roles**:
  - Project Lead: Oversees progress and coordination.
  - Data Specialist: Implements extraction, filtering, and validation logic.
  - Documentation Specialist: Maintains detailed methodology and usage docs.

### Constraints
- No usage of external APIs, cloud storage, enterprise servers, or microservices.
- Strict adherence to data privacy and exclusion rules.
- Designed for small-scale data processing within local environments.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. Test Coverage Plan

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Each module’s function will have dedicated tests covering edge cases and error handling (e.g., invalid file formats, missing fields).
- **Integration Testing**: Validate end-to-end workflows from data extraction through report generation.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure that updates do not break existing functionalities.

### Key Test Scenarios
- Validate that CSV/JSON files are correctly parsed into structured records.
- Ensure filtering functions remove contractors and founder’s family members.
- Verify that the tenure evaluator only includes employees with ≥10 years.
- Confirm that the generated PDF report and Markdown documentation are non-empty and correctly formatted.

Sample unit test for tenure qualification:
```python
def test_check_tenure_qualification():
    test_records = [
        {"employee_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "tenure": 12, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"},
        {"employee_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "tenure": 8, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"}
    ]
    qualified = check_tenure_qualification(test_records, min_years=10)
    assert len(qualified) == 1
    assert qualified[0]["name"] == "Alice"
```

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Integration Specifications

- **Interfaces**: Each module exposes functions that allow chaining outputs directly into the next module.
- **Module Dependencies**: 
  - The output of the Data Extraction Module feeds into the Data Validation & Filtering Module.
  - Validated data is passed sequentially to the Qualification Rule Engine.
  - Outputs from the rule engine feed both the Report Generation and Documentation Modules.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Consistent error logging via a dedicated Logger ensures traceability.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Performance Requirements

- **Small-Scale Data**: Optimized for local processing of HR records in the range of a few hundred employees.
- **Modular Efficiency**: Code modules are designed to be lightweight and fast in execution. Any performance bottlenecks (e.g., file I/O operations) will be addressed during integration testing.
- **Future Scalability**: Although designed for small-scale use (no enterprise architecture), the modular design allows for future refactoring if data volumes increase.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Implementation Timeline and Phases

    Args:
      filepath: Path to the input file.
    Returns:
      List of employee records (dictionaries).
    """
    # implementation here
    pass

def validate_and_filter_data(data: list) -> list:
    """
    Validates employee record structure and applies exclusion rules.
    
    Args:
      data: List of employee records.
    Returns:
      Filtered list of employee records.
    """
    # implementation here
    pass

def check_tenure_qualification(data: list, min_years: int = 10) -> list:
    """

```

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. Data Models and Schemas

### Employee Record Schema
```json
{
  "employee_id": "string or integer",
  "name": "string",
  "tenure": "float or integer (years)",
  "employment_status": "string (e.g., full-time, contractor)",
  "relation_to_founder": "boolean or string (yes/no)"
}
```

### Validation Criteria:
- Tenure must be numeric and greater than or equal to 10.
- employment_status should not equal "contractor".
- relation_to_founder should be False or "no".

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Testing Strategy per Module

### Testing Approach:
- **Unit Tests:** Test each function individually with different edge cases (e.g., missing fields, incorrect data types).
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure data flows correctly between modules, e.g., data output from extractor feeds correctly into the validator.
- **Regression Tests:** Validate that future code changes do not break established functionality.

### Key Test Scenarios:
- Valid CSV/JSON input produces a correct list of employee records.
- Incorrect file format or missing records trigger expected validation errors.
- Exclusion filters correctly remove contractors and founder’s family.
- Tenure evaluation correctly identifies employees with ≥10 years.
- Report generation creates a non-empty PDF and correct markdown documentation.

### Sample Unit Test (using pytest)
```python
def test_check_tenure_qualification():
    test_records = [
        {"employee_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "tenure": 12, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"},
        {"employee_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "tenure": 8, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"}
    ]
    qualified = check_tenure_qualification(test_records, min_years=10)
    assert len(qualified) == 1
    assert qualified[0]["name"] == "Alice"
```

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Implementation Priorities and Sequence

### Priority Order:
1. **Data Extraction Module**
   - Implement file reading functions (CSV/JSON) with error handling.
2. **Data Validation & Filtering Module**
   - Define and implement data format checking and exclusion rules.
3. **Tenure Evaluation (Qualification Rule Engine)**
   - Code the function to check tenure criteria.
4. **Report Generation Module**
   - Create PDF generation and Markdown documentation functions.
5. **Integration Testing**
   - Combine modules and run through full end-to-end tests.
6. **Documentation and Code Review**
   - Update docs based on code modifiers and iterate based on team feedback.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Technical Debt Considerations

- **Short-Term Simplicity:**  
  - Use basic Python libraries; however, note that repeated parsing of large CSV/JSON files may need optimization.
- **Refactoring Possibilities:**  
  - As complexity grows, consider refactoring into separate classes for data I/O and business logic.
- **Testing Framework Expansion:**  
  - Initially use pytest, but potential to integrate Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines (like GitHub Actions) for regular testing.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Ensure inline comments are maintained. Code readability should be preserved as additional features are added.

# code_technical_design.md

## 1. Complete Technical Architecture

### System Overview
The Senior Employee Identification System is a lightweight, local solution that extracts HR data from CSV/JSON files, validates and filters out records (excluding contractors and founder’s family), evaluates tenure criteria, and generates a validated PDF report along with supplementary Markdown documentation. The design emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and adherence to data privacy requirements.

### Module Breakdown & Components
| Module                            | Role                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Extraction Module            | Read and parse employee records from CSV/JSON files.                 |
| Data Validation & Filtering Module| Validate record structure and apply exclusion rules.                 |
| Qualification Rule Engine         | Check if each record meets the 10+ years tenure criteria.            |
| Report Generation Module          | Generate a PDF report and create Markdown documentation.             |
| Methodology Documentation Module  | Capture and archive decision logs and processing criteria.           |

### Data Flow Diagram (Mermaid Syntax)

  C --> D[Qualification Rule Engine]
  D --> E[Report Generation Module]
  D --> F[Methodology Documentation Module]
  E --> G[Final Validated Report (PDF)]
  F --> H[Documentation Archive (Markdown)]
```

### Integration & Interface Contracts
- Interfaces are defined as simple Python functions:
  - extract_employee_data(filepath) → list
  - validate_and_filter_data(data) → list
  - check_tenure_qualification(data, min_years=10) → list
  - generate_report(qualified_employees, output_path) → None
  - generate_documentation(details, output_path) → None

These interfaces support integration within a local, file-based workflow and enable each module to operate and be independently testable.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 2. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Identified Risks
- **Data Inaccuracy**: Input files may contain corrupted or unexpected formats.
- **Exclusion Rule Misapplication**: Risk of incorrectly including contractors or family members.
- **Project Delays**: Dependencies between sequential module development can introduce risks.
- **Performance Issues**: Repeated parsing of files may lead to delays if data volume increases.

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Data Validation Checks**: Implement rigorous parsing and type-checking routines in the extraction module.
- **Rule Verification Testing**: Develop unit tests to ensure exclusion filters work correctly.
- **Regular Progress Reviews**: Schedule checkpoints (e.g., November 15) to assess module readiness and coordinate integration.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Optimize file I/O routines and comment code for easier refactoring later if data volumes rise.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 3. Resource Requirements and Constraints

### Resource Requirements
- **Existing Assets**: Use current HR CSV/JSON files and local workstations.
- **Programming Environment**: Python 3.x, supporting libraries (pandas, ReportLab/matplotlib, PyYAML/Markdown).
- **Version Control**: GitHub for source control.
- **Team Roles**:
  - Project Lead: Oversees progress and coordination.
  - Data Specialist: Implements extraction, filtering, and validation logic.
  - Documentation Specialist: Maintains detailed methodology and usage docs.

### Constraints
- No usage of external APIs, cloud storage, enterprise servers, or microservices.
- Strict adherence to data privacy and exclusion rules.
- Designed for small-scale data processing within local environments.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. Test Coverage Plan

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Each module’s function will have dedicated tests covering edge cases and error handling (e.g., invalid file formats, missing fields).
- **Integration Testing**: Validate end-to-end workflows from data extraction through report generation.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure that updates do not break existing functionalities.

### Key Test Scenarios
- Validate that CSV/JSON files are correctly parsed into structured records.
- Ensure filtering functions remove contractors and founder’s family members.
- Verify that the tenure evaluator only includes employees with ≥10 years.
- Confirm that the generated PDF report and Markdown documentation are non-empty and correctly formatted.

Sample unit test for tenure qualification:
```python
def test_check_tenure_qualification():
    test_records = [
        {"employee_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "tenure": 12, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"},
        {"employee_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "tenure": 8, "employment_status": "full-time", "relation_to_founder": "no"}
    ]
    qualified = check_tenure_qualification(test_records, min_years=10)
    assert len(qualified) == 1
    assert qualified[0]["name"] == "Alice"
```

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Integration Specifications

- **Interfaces**: Each module exposes functions that allow chaining outputs directly into the next module.
- **Module Dependencies**: 
  - The output of the Data Extraction Module feeds into the Data Validation & Filtering Module.
  - Validated data is passed sequentially to the Qualification Rule Engine.
  - Outputs from the rule engine feed both the Report Generation and Documentation Modules.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Consistent error logging via a dedicated Logger ensures traceability.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Performance Requirements

- **Small-Scale Data**: Optimized for local processing of HR records in the range of a few hundred employees.
- **Modular Efficiency**: Code modules are designed to be lightweight and fast in execution. Any performance bottlenecks (e.g., file I/O operations) will be addressed during integration testing.
- **Future Scalability**: Although designed for small-scale use (no enterprise architecture), the modular design allows for future refactoring if data volumes increase.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Implementation Timeline and Phases

| Phase                              | Timeline                | Key Deliverables                          |

## 1. Final Technical Architecture

### System Overview
The Senior Employee Identification System is a lightweight, local solution that extracts HR data from CSV/JSON files, applies strict validation (including exclusion of contractors and founder’s family), evaluates employee tenure, and generates a validated PDF report along with detailed Markdown documentation. This system is designed for small-scale use and relies solely on local resources, ensuring data privacy and compliance with internal policies.

### Module Breakdown & Components

| Module                              | Role                                                                        |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Extraction Module              | Reads and parses employee records from CSV/JSON files.                     |
| Data Validation & Filtering Module  | Validates record structure and excludes contractors and founder’s family.   |
| Qualification Rule Engine           | Checks if each record meets the ≥10 years tenure requirement.               |
| Report Generation Module            | Generates a PDF report and creates supplementary Markdown documentation.    |
| Methodology Documentation Module    | Archives decision logs and processing details for traceability.             |

### Integration & Interface Contracts
- **Interfaces (Function Signatures):**
  - extract_employee_data(filepath: str) → list  
  - validate_and_filter_data(data: list) → list  
  - check_tenure_qualification(data: list, min_years: int = 10) → list  
  - generate_report(qualified_employees: list, output_path: str) → None  
  - generate_documentation(details: dict, output_path: str) → None  

These interfaces allow each module to integrate seamlessly in a local, file-based workflow and support independent testing.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 2. Implementation Feasibility Confirmation
- **Approach:** A simple Python scripting solution using libraries such as pandas, ReportLab or matplotlib, and Markdown/PyYAML is feasible given the small-scale HR data.
- **Local Environment:** Implementation will run locally on designated workstations using existing CSV/JSON files without the need for external APIs or cloud resources.
- **Modularity:** The design is modular, allowing each component to be developed, tested, and maintained separately.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 3. Risk Mitigation Plan

### Identified Risks & Mitigation Strategies

- **Data Inaccuracy:**  
  - Mitigation: Implement rigorous data validation checks (e.g., type checking, format verification) in the extraction module.  
  - Testing: Unit tests will cover various edge cases and formats.

- **Exclusion Rule Misapplication:**  
  - Mitigation: Enforce unit tests specifically targeting exclusion filters.  
  - Process: Regular rule verification meetings to ensure criteria are correctly applied.

- **Project Delays:**  
  - Mitigation: Hold weekly progress reviews and adjust assignments as needed.  
  - Monitoring: Use task boards and continuous updates on GitHub.

- **Performance Bottlenecks:**  
  - Mitigation: Optimize file I/O operations and refactor if data volume increases.  
  - Testing: Utilize integration tests to measure module performance.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 4. Resource Allocation

- **Existing Assets:** HR CSV/JSON files are already available.
- **Team Roles:**
  - **Project Lead:** Oversees overall progress and coordinates between technical and documentation teams.
  - **Data Specialist:** Implements extraction, validation, and tenure evaluation modules.
  - **Documentation Specialist:** Maintains all project documentation, ensures methodology traceability.
- **Execution Environment:** Local workstations with Python 3.x and related libraries; version control via GitHub.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 5. Quality Assurance Process

- **Unit Testing:**  
  - Each function will be individually verified using edge case tests (e.g., missing fields, corrupted formats).
- **Integration Testing:**  
  - Ensure correct data flow across modules (e.g., output from Data Extraction feeds correctly into Validation).
- **Regression Testing:**  
  - Continuous testing using CI (e.g., GitHub Actions) to ensure code changes do not break functionality.
- **Documentation Reviews:**  
  - All design and methodology documentation will be peer-reviewed to ensure clear traceability and consistency with project objectives.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 6. Deployment Strategy

- **Local Deployment:**  
  - The system will be deployed on designated workstations without reliance on external servers.  
- **Version Control:**  
  - All code and documentation are maintained in a GitHub repository with regular commits and code reviews.
- **Output Delivery:**  
  - Final PDF reports and Markdown documentation will be stored in `/projects/senior_employee_identification/deliverables/` and archived in the GitHub repository.
- **Release Checkpoints:**  
  - Follow-up meetings (next progress review on November 15) will verify integration and readiness before the final sign-off.

────────────────────────────────────────────
## 7. Maintenance Plan

- **Post-Deployment Support:**  
  - The project team will monitor the system for any issues during initial use and address reported bugs.
- **Updates & Enhancements:**  
  - Future improvements (e.g., additional exclusion criteria or performance optimizations) will be planned and implemented as needed.
- **Documentation Updates:**  
  - All changes and enhancements will be documented in the methodology documentation, ensuring ongoing traceability.
- **Periodic Reviews:**  
  - Scheduled reviews post-deployment to verify continued compliance with internal data privacy guidelines and technical standards.

────────────────────────────────────────────
