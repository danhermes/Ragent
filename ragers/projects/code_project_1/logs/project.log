2025-04-21 20:08:41,293 - INFO - =========== Response from Manager:
**PROBLEM ANALYSIS**

The task at hand involves leveraging a small-scale technical project to identify senior employees who have over ten years of tenure while excluding contractors and family of the founder. This process must utilize existing HR database records, automate the data extraction, ensure data integrity, and provide a validated report. The project is constrained to use simple scripts without the need for enterprise infrastructure, focusing on internal resources and ensuring data privacy compliance.
