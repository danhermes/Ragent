I. Business Use Cases
---------------------
- Customer Experience: GPT-powered onboarding, triage, and reporting using Assistants API, Azure RAG, Speech Services.
- Process Automation: LangGraph + Foundry flows for SOPs, document automation, retry logic.
- Decision Support: Dashboard-to-dialogue agents with Tool Calling, RAG pipelines, and cosine similarity ranking.
- Workforce Enablement: Async agents using Semantic Kernel, Assistants API for onboarding, documentation, training.
- Risk & Compliance: Guardrail-bound agents with Entra ID, audit logging, and Content Safety.
- Monitoring & Observability: Langfuse, App Insights, LangSmith for trace replay and performance metrics.
- Multi-modal Interfaces: GPT-4o, Azure Vision/Speech to process and respond to image/audio input.
- Enterprise Architecture: Foundry, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, and Kernel integration to manage tools, memory, retrieval.

II. Agentic Frameworks
----------------------
- Agents are autonomous deciders/adapters, not static programs.
- Agent Components: Tool use, LLM APIs, memory (short/long), reasoning core.
- Orchestration: LangGraph, LangChain Hub, Assistants API, LCEL.
- Agent Types: ReAct, plan-and-execute, action agents, generative agents.
- Techniques: Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, callbacks, embedded function execution.
- Examples: AutoGPT, BabyAGI, LangChain agents, OpenAI Assistants.
- Memory & Retrieval: FAISS, Pinecone, LangChain + LlamaIndex integrations.

III. LLMs / GenAI
-----------------
- Transformer architecture: attention, tokenization, encoder/decoder stacks.
- Generation Parameters: temperature, top-k/p, frequency penalties, stop sequences.
- Prompt Engineering: ICL (zero/one/few-shot), format prompting, role prompting, self-consistency.
- RAG vs Fine-tuning: RAG enables dynamic, real-time grounding; LoRA/PEFT for parametric tuning.
