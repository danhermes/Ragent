WORK ON THIS CODE, GUYS.
I communicate with Ragent director Blaine - give him starter code and test data
Blaine oversees Woz, the tech wiz. Woz gives updates to Blaine. Woz has access to autocoder:
I think autocoder needs these methods for Woz to call: code(),test(),debug()
I think autocoder needs a test harness function to mock these calls: ChatGPT, files, databases,anything....give it an in/out/storage.
When Woz gets code working he gives update Blaine and Blaine notifies me.

Suggested Next Step: Roadmap
We split MVP polish into two fast sprints:

üß± MVP Polish A: Author-Centric
Parse .goal (even as a simple .json)

Implement formatter.py (style rules)

Support per-chapter .md output

CLI --chapter, --book, --test args

‚öôÔ∏è MVP Polish B: Tech-Scale
Add ChatGPTClient for real calls

RAG doc injection (rag_docs param ‚Üí prompt embedding)

Grimm-style moral generation from original prompt

Template memory or tone-tracking per chapter


Pile 2: ToDo Pile ‚Äî Everything Else
Features for future-proofing, advanced scaling, or non-Business book use cases.

üß© Modular Expansion
 Generator support for essays, LinkedIn posts, talks

 Paragraph-only and microformats (e.g. haiku, tweet threads)

 Narrative arcs (pedagogical scaffolding, conflict/resolution, persona arcs)

 Dynamic persona insertions (Elena returns!)

 Plugin-based formatter extensions (e.g. tone shift per section)

üï∏Ô∏è Full RAG Architecture
 Semantic vector indexing for doc inclusion

 Retrieval-based prompt injection

 Support for multiple roles/domains in a single book

üì¶ Output & Publishing
 Export to .docx, .pdf, .epub via pandoc or python-docx

 Print layout engine (chapter headers, section footers)

 Front/back cover generation (art + text)

üß± Narrative Matrix
 Matrix-based orchestration (TOC √ó style √ó role √ó narrative arc)

 Big Ideas propagation: themes woven subtly across chapters

 Conceptual threads and callback motifs

ü§ñ Agentic Support
 Live hooks for Rangers (inject .goal adjustments mid-run)

 Feedback loops: GPT-based critique ‚Üí regenerate weak sections

 Memoization of prompts, examples, structures (shared storybank)

Out-of-Scope Features for LitLegos MVP
1. generate_paragraph() and mid-level block composition
We parked this because we haven‚Äôt locked down what constitutes a "paragraph" yet in terms of function: insight unit? rhetorical block? pattern element?

2. Book auto-assembly with visual layout / export to PDF/Word
Cool as hell, but layout/rendering and styling logic is a big beast. MVP sticks to plain text or markdown.

3. Agentic self-critique or iterative re-drafting
No review cycles, voting, or rewriting chains in the MVP. Those loops go in the ‚Äúsmart second-pass engine‚Äù column.

4. Dynamic plugin architecture for new content types (e.g., poem, chart, scene, tweetstorm)
MVP focuses on structured book-generation, not a universal content synthesizer. Plugins will be awesome later, once the core API is stable.

5. Live chat integration with generation (e.g., author GPT co-writing assistant)
MVP is script-based. No full conversational interface until the pipeline‚Äôs tight and predictable.

6. RAG-enabled topic synthesis from uploaded source folders
We set aside anything involving document ingestion, vector search, or contextual recall ‚Äî too heavy for v1.

7. Voice or multimodal input (e.g., sketch a TOC on a whiteboard)
We had dreams of napkin-to-narrative via image/voice input, but that‚Äôs post-MVP territory.

8. User-facing dashboard or web UI
All MVP interactions are CLI or code-based. No UI/UX layer, no frontend, no userspace management.

9. Autonomous pipeline execution from .goal files (fully hands-off)
MVP still assumes you hit the buttons. Fully autonomous flow from vision to book is for v2.

10. Memory between book generations / history tracking
No persistent store of previous generations, no logs or time-machine browsing yet. MVP lives in the moment.
