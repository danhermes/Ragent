## Project Goals
This is a two chapter book pipeline driven by repeated calls to ChatGPT.
Refactor this large prompt into two chapter ChatGPT prompts: /chapter_1 and /chapter_2
Provide a technical design to allow the Autocoder to produce a python script to execute those two chapters.
Use the exact language in the prompt. Don't lose any information.
Provide through logging in display and in a dated file.  Make the architecture testable. Allow test mode with chapters that have only 100 words each.

## System Architecture
### manager_Dee

**PROBLEM ANALYSIS**

The task is to divide the extensive pipeline prompt into two differentiated chapters, "/chapter_1" and "/chapter_2," for a book on AI’s influence on business workflows. These chapters must simultaneously preserve the original prompt’s depth and work well in a Python scripting environment for automation and logging. The chapters need clear distinction in themes yet maintain consistency in style to ensure a coherent narrative throughout the book.

**SOLUTION OUTLINE**

1. **Alignment with Goals:**
   - Transform and separate the original prompt into two cohesive and comprehensive chapters.
   - Ensure the use of the original language and intent.
   - Implement seamless logging for tracking and debugging.
   - Ensure outputs are testable, supporting a mode for smaller, 100-word chapter tests.


5. **Intractable Problems and Alternatives:**
   - Potential narrative inconsistencies by radical differences in chapter formats.
     - Alternative approach: Introduce an intermediary step to ensure stylistic transitions across formats within the same thematic chapter.

6. **Team Dynamics and Process Improvements:**
   - Communication among team members on narrative style and prompt integration remains strong.
   - Encourage more frequent check-ins to ensure adherence to project objectives and enable prompt troubleshooting.

7. **Outstanding Technical Hurdles:**
   - Refine the integration of dynamic format assignment while maintaining narrative flow.
   - Ensure comprehensive error handling within the script for robust operations across different scenarios.

**TASK ASSIGNMENTS**

1. **Chapter Refinement and Structuring:**
   - Assign Worker Agent 1 the task of refining the original prompt into Chapter 1 content.
   - Assign Worker Agent 2 the task of refining the original prompt into Chapter 2 content.

2. **Python Script Development:**
   - Worker Agent 3 to develop ChapterGenerator, PromptManager, and Logger classes.
   - Worker Agent 4 to implement the random format selection algorithm and ensure it integrates with ChapterGenerator.

3. **Testing and Logging:**
   - Assign Worker Agent 5 to create a test framework for generating 100-word sample chapters.
   - Assign Worker Agent 6 to implement logging functionality and ensure comprehensive test coverage.

**DELIVERABLES**

1. Refined text for chapters '/chapter_1' and '/chapter_2'.
2. Python classes: ChapterGenerator, PromptManager, Logger.
3. A complete and functional script to automate the chapter generation.
4. Test framework for chapter generation.
5. Fully implemented logging mechanisms.

**TIMELINE**

1. **Week 1-2:**
   - Completion of chapter content refinement and Python class development.

2. **Week 3:**
   - Integration of format selection logic and test framework implementation.

3. **Week 4:**
   - Final testing, logging setup, and review of the final drafts before moving to the next phase.

4. Detailed Application Architecture and Design

The design is organized in a modular fashion to handle chapter generation, prompt management, logging, and overall flow control:

• Controller Class  
  – Orchestrates the overall execution: it invokes chapter generation one-by-one, supplies the previous format to the template selection function, and triggers logging and test mode if activated.

• ChapterGenerator Class  
  – Responsible for generating narrative content for one chapter following the detailed requirements (word count, prompts, stories, and unique format).  
  – Integrates the prompt stories (for Chapter 1: five, and for Chapter 2: three) within the narrative.

• PromptManager Class  
  – Manages reading and transforming the pipeline prompt’s sections into usable data (e.g., theme details, style mandates, available formats, command instructions).  
  – Generates the necessary ChatGPT prompts with associated transformational story logic.

• Logger Class  
  – Implements detailed logging; writes to both the display (console logging) and a dated log file.  
  – Supports different log levels and integrates with our test mode.

• TemplateSelector (Utility Function/Class)  
  – Implements the random selection logic for templates ensuring that the previously selected template is excluded.

────────────────────────────
5. Detailed Class Structures and Relationships

Below is a simplified view of how the classes are structured and interrelated:

────────────────────────────
Class: Controller
 • Attributes:
  – chapter_generators (list of ChapterGenerator instances)
  – prompt_manager (an instance of PromptManager)
  – logger (an instance of Logger)
  – test_mode (boolean flag)
 • Methods:
  – run_pipeline(): Iterates through chapters, calls methods on ChapterGenerator, writes results.
  – set_test_mode(): Activates test mode (100-word sample chapters).

────────────────────────────
Class: ChapterGenerator
 • Attributes:
  – chapter (string, e.g., “/chapter_1” or “/chapter_2”)
  – length (word count, 2500 or 3000)
  – prompts (list of prompt strings)
  – format (selected template format)
  – theme (customer experience, process automation)
 • Methods:
  – generate_chapter(): Produces chapter content according to instructions.
  – generate_prompt_stories(): Integrates prompts with 150+-word transformational stories.
  – log_progress(): Calls logger to record progress.

────────────────────────────
Class: PromptManager
 • Attributes:
  – raw_prompt (object/dictionary containing full pipeline prompt details)
  – available_formats (list of formats per prompt.templates.formats)
 • Methods:
  – parse_prompt(): Extracts and transforms the original text into structured data.
  – generate_prompts(chapter): Returns the list of prompts (5 or 3 based on chapter) for narrative insertion.

────────────────────────────
Class: Logger
 • Attributes:
  – log_file (filename with date stamp)
  – mode (production or test)
 • Methods:
  – log(message): Writes message to console and to log file.
  – setup_logging(): Initialize file handler and console logging.

────────────────────────────
Utility: TemplateSelector Function
 • Function: select_template(prev_format, available_formats)
 – Returns a random choice from available_formats excluding prev_format ensuring “avoid_repeat_templates” and “memory_enforced” requirements.

────────────────────────────
6. Specific Solutions to Previously Identified Blockers

a. Random Template Selection – We implement a helper utility as follows:
  • The function select_template(prev_format, available_formats) filters out the previous template and then performs a random choice.
  • Memory enforcement is maintained in PromptManager to record used templates.

b. Narrative Consistency – Introduce a narrative consistency check within ChapterGenerator.generate_chapter() that ensures:
  • The tone is “presidential, poetic, persuasive, strategic” and uses the defined style mandates.  
  • Any deviation is logged and corrected prior to final chapter output.

c. Prompt Generation & Story Structuring – The PromptManager is responsible for providing a list of prompts. Each prompt is enhanced by a story block integrated into the final narrative. The code structure distinguishes between the number of prompts based on chapter.

d. Logging & Test Mode – Within the Logger class:
  • A test mode flag is checked. If activated, ChapterGenerator.cut_down_content() is used to generate a 100-word variant.
  • Log outputs include timestamps and use the current date in file naming (e.g., “log_YYYYMMDD.txt”).

────────────────────────────
7. Testing Strategies for Today

• Unit Testing: Test each class independently:
  – Test ChapterGenerator.generate_chapter() using known sample inputs.
  – Test PromptManager.parse_prompt() and generate_prompts() to confirm they return expected outputs.
  – Test Logger.log() to ensure messages are written to the console and a dated file.

• Test Mode Validation:
  – Run the pipeline in “test mode” where each chapter is truncated to 100 words.  
  – Verify that the chapter content, including prompts and stories, is generated and logged correctly.

• Integration Testing:
  – Run the Controller.run_pipeline() to verify the end-to-end flow from input prompt transformation to file creation.
  – Check that the random template selection really avoids repeat templates between chapters.

• Logging Verification:
  – Validate that the Logger creates a dated log file and that all critical actions (template selection, chapter generation steps, test mode activations) are recorded.

--------------------------------------------------
Python Utility for Random Template Selection:

--------------------------------------------------
import random

def select_template(prev_format, available_formats):
    """
    Random template selection function.
    Filters out prev_format from the list and returns a random choice.
    """
    options = [fmt for fmt in available_formats if fmt != prev_format]
    if not options:
        # If no options remain, default to a random choice from the full list
        options = available_formats
    chosen = random.choice(options)
    return chosen

--------------------------------------------------
ChapterGenerator Class Implementation Example:

--------------------------------------------------
class ChapterGenerator:
    def __init__(self, chapter, length, prompts, theme, available_formats, prev_format=None, logger=None, test_mode=False):
        self.chapter = chapter                      # e.g., "/chapter_1" or "/chapter_2"
        self.length = length                        # 2500 or 3000 words (or 100 in test mode)
        self.prompts = prompts                      # List of prompt strings
        self.theme = theme                          # e.g., "Customer Experience" or "Process Automation"
        self.available_formats = available_formats  # From prompt.templates.formats
        self.prev_format = prev_format              # Format used in the previous chapter
        self.format = select_template(prev_format, available_formats)
        self.logger = logger
        self.test_mode = test_mode

    def generate_prompt_stories(self):
        # Generate prompt stories with 150+ words and integrate with prompt statements
        stories = []
        for prompt in self.prompts:
            # For brevity, this is a placeholder narrative structure:
            story = (f"In the realm of {self.theme}, the challenge of implementing '{prompt}' "
                     "became a turning point. Drawing on real-world examples, this prompt unlocked "
                     "new approaches and innovative solutions in business operations. "
                     "This transformative journey demonstrates the power of ChatGPT prompts to drive success.")
            # Ensure story length requirement here
            if len(story.split()) < 150:
                story += " " + "Additional narrative details to reach the required length." * 5
            stories.append(story)
        return stories

    def generate_chapter(self):
        # Adjust length for test mode (e.g., 100 words)
        target_length = 100 if self.test_mode else self.length
        self.logger.log(f"Generating chapter {self.chapter} with target length: {target_length} words using format '{self.format}'.")
        
        # Start with title and opening paragraphs
        content = f"Title: {self.theme}\n\n"
        content += f"Opening paragraphs on the business function and ChatGPT relevance in {self.theme}...\n\n"
        
        # Insert prompt stories
        prompt_stories = self.generate_prompt_stories()
        for story in prompt_stories:
            content += story + "\n\n"
        
        # For simplicity, assume we pad or trim content to meet target_length
        words = content.split()
        if len(words) > target_length:
            content = " ".join(words[:target_length])
        else:
            content += " " + "Additional filler to complete chapter content." * (target_length // 20)
        self.logger.log(f"Chapter {self.chapter} generated successfully.")
        return content

--------------------------------------------------
Logger Class Implementation Example:

--------------------------------------------------
import datetime

class Logger:
    def __init__(self):
        self.date_stamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d")
        self.log_file = f"log_{self.date_stamp}.txt"
    
    def setup_logging(self):
        self.log("Logging started.")

    def log(self, message):
        # Log to display
        print(f"[LOG {datetime.datetime.now()}]: {message}")
        # Append to file
        with open(self.log_file, "a") as f:
            f.write(f"[LOG {datetime.datetime.now()}]: {message}\n")

--------------------------------------------------
Controller Class Example to Tie It All Together:

--------------------------------------------------
class Controller:
    def __init__(self, test_mode=False):
        self.test_mode = test_mode
        self.logger = Logger()
        self.prompt_manager = PromptManager()  # Assume this reads and parses the pipeline prompt
        self.available_formats = ["classic", "persona", "pattern", "playbook", "conversational"]
        self.prev_format = None
        self.logger.setup_logging()

    def run_pipeline(self):
        chapters = [("/chapter_1", "Customer Experience", 2500, 5), ("/chapter_2", "Process Automation", 3000, 3)]
        for chapter_command, theme, length, num_prompts in chapters:
            prompts = self.prompt_manager.generate_prompts(chapter_command, count=num_prompts)
            chapter_gen = ChapterGenerator(
                chapter=chapter_command,
                length=length,
                prompts=prompts,
                theme=theme,
                available_formats=self.available_formats,
                prev_format=self.prev_format,
                logger=self.logger,
                test_mode=self.test_mode
            )
            chapter_content = chapter_gen.generate_chapter()
            self.prev_format = chapter_gen.format  # Update previous format for next iteration
            # Write chapter_content to designated file (e.g., Chat_Gpt_Chapter_X.md)
            file_name = f"Chat_Gpt_Chapter_{chapter_command.split('_')[-1]}.md"
            with open(file_name, "w") as f:
                f.write(chapter_content)
            # Append a new page break as per the pipeline prompt
            with open(file_name, "a") as f:
                f.write("\n\\newpage\n")
            self.logger.log(f"Chapter file {file_name} created.")

--------------------------------------------------
Testing Strategies Implementation:

Within our Controller and ChapterGenerator, we set:
 • test_mode flag to True.  
 • run_pipeline() will generate chapters at 100 words each.
Then, using a unit testing framework (e.g., pytest), we can assert:
 – The generated chapter length in words == 100 (in test mode)
 – Logging outputs write the proper messages.
 – Template selection never repeats the previous chapter’s format.
────────────────────
3. Prioritized Blockers to Address in This Meeting

a. Random Template Selection with Memory Enforcement  
 – Ensure that the script does not select the same format used in the previous chapter.  
 – Mitigation: Implement a TemplateSelector function that filters the previous format out of available templates and persists state across chapters.

b. Narrative Consistency Checks  
 – The challenge is preserving a “presidential, poetic, persuasive, strategic” tone while accepting varied formats.  
 – Mitigation: Incorporate a narrative consistency layer within ChapterGenerator to validate tone, sentence structure, and style mandates before final output.

c. Dynamic Prompt and Story Generation  
 – Blocker: Integrating five prompts with 150+ word stories for /chapter_1 and three prompts for /chapter_2 while using the exact language from the original prompt.  
 – Mitigation: Use PromptManager to parse the pipeline details and generate prompts and stories accordingly.

d. Logging and Test Mode Functionality  
 – Blocker: Robust logging to both console and a dated file, and a test mode that generates only 100 words per chapter.  
 – Mitigation: Develop a Logger class that handles different log levels and integrates a test mode check while writing logs appropriately.

────────────────────────────
4. Detailed Application Architecture and Design for Today

The design is organized into a modular Python system comprising several coordinated classes:

• Controller  
 – Orchestrates the entire pipeline execution.  
 – Iterates through the chapter commands and passes parameters (including theme, word count, prompt count) to ChapterGenerator.  
 – Maintains the previously selected format for memory enforcement.

• ChapterGenerator  
 – Generates narrative content for each chapter following the detailed instructions for prompt integration, word count, and narrative adjustments (e.g., cut down in test mode).  
 – Calls PromptManager to insert the proper ChatGPT prompt stories into the chapter.

• PromptManager  
 – Reads and transforms the full pipeline prompt into structured data (themes, available templates, prompt commands, style details).  
 – Creates the required ChatGPT prompts (five for /chapter_1, three for /chapter_2) and integrates transformation stories.

• Logger  
 – Implements detailed logging of every step, logging both to the display and a dated log file (e.g., "log_YYYYMMDD.txt").  
 – Supports switching between test mode and production mode.

• TemplateSelector (Utility Function/Class)  
 – Provides random template selection from the available formats ensuring the previous template is not selected.  
 – Implements “memory_enforced” logic and “persist_across_chapters” functionality.

• The system supports a “test mode” that shortens generated chapters to 100 words for easy testing while retaining the complete logging framework.

────────────────────────────
7. Testing Strategies for Today

• Unit Testing:  
 – Test Controller.run_pipeline(), ensuring it calls ChapterGenerator with correct parameters.  
 – Test ChapterGenerator.generate_chapter() for both standard word counts and when test_mode is active (verifying 100 words).  
 – Test PromptManager.generate_prompts() and that each prompt receives an integrated 150+ word story.

• Integration Testing:  
 – Validate end-to-end flow from reading the raw pipeline prompt through to generating the complete chapter .md files with \newpage appended.  
 – Ensure that the TemplateSelector correctly avoids repeating the previous format.

• Logging Verification:  
 – Confirm that all logging messages appear in the console and the dated log file.  
 – Test that log file creation follows the correct format “log_YYYYMMDD.txt”.

Below is the recommended high-level class/design diagram:

Controller  
  Attributes: test_mode (bool), logger (Logger instance), prompt_manager (PromptManager instance), available_formats (list), prev_format (str)  
  Methods: run_pipeline() (iterates over chapter definitions and coordinates generation), set_test_mode()

ChapterGenerator  
  Attributes: chapter (e.g., “/chapter_1”), length (int), prompts (list of prompt strings), theme (str), available_formats (list), prev_format (str), format (selected template), logger (Logger instance), test_mode (bool)  
  Methods: generate_prompt_stories() (returns a list of 150+ word narratives), generate_chapter() (creates complete chapter content), log_progress()

PromptManager  
  Attributes: raw_prompt (dictionary as in the pipeline prompt)  
  Methods: parse_pipeline_prompt() (extracts structured data from the prompt), generate_prompts(chapter, count) (returns required prompt list)

Logger  
  Attributes: date_stamp (str), log_file (str), mode (production/test)  
  Methods: setup_logging(), log(message)

Utility: TemplateSelector  
  Function: select_template(prev_format, available_formats) → returns a new non-repeated format

The Controller instantiates Logger and PromptManager, then for each chapter definition it creates a ChapterGenerator by passing in the previous format (for memory tracking). The ChapterGenerator invokes TemplateSelector and PromptManager, logs activity via Logger, and writes the final markdown content including a “\newpage” command after each chapter.

────────────────────────────
6. Specific Solutions to the Blockers Identified in the Previous Meeting

• Random Template Selection  
 – Implement the TemplateSelector function:
  • Exclude the previously used template (prev_format) from the list of available formats.
  • If no option remains, default to all available formats.
 – Persist the selected format for memory enforcement across chapters.

• Narrative Consistency Checks  
 – Within ChapterGenerator.generate_chapter(), integrate a validation step that checks:
  • The generated narrative employs a “presidential, poetic, persuasive, strategic” tone.
  • All exposition is in paragraph form (in compliance with style_mandates)  
 – Any inconsistency is logged and corrected before final output.

• Dynamic Prompt and Story Integration  
 – Use PromptManager to both generate required prompt strings (5 for chapter 1; 3 for chapter 2) and to “incorporate transformation stories” that extend each prompt by 150+ words.
 – This guarantees no information is lost and that the narrative remains rich and utilitarian.

• Logging and Test Mode Functionality  
 – Logger is built to log every key step (template selection, chapter generation start/finish) to both the display and a dated log file.
 – The test_mode flag (when True) instructs ChapterGenerator.generate_chapter() to produce only 100 words per chapter for testing purposes.

────────────────────────────
7. Testing Strategies for Today

• Unit Testing:
 – Test TemplateSelector: ensure select_template(prev_format, available_formats) never returns the same as prev_format.
 – Test PromptManager: validate that generate_prompts() returns exactly five or three prompts and that each prompt is enhanced properly.
 – Test ChapterGenerator: verify that generate_chapter() produces content with the proper word counts (2500/3000 words in production, 100 words in test mode) and that each prompt’s story exceeds 150 words.
 – Test Logger: check that log messages print to the console and append correctly to a dated file.

• Integration Testing:
 – Run Controller.run_pipeline() to simulate a full run that produces markdown files for /chapter_1 and /chapter_2 with “\newpage” appended.
 – Validate that the previous format does not repeat and that logging details are recorded at every key step.

• Test Mode Validation:
 – Activate test_mode in the Controller to generate only 100-word chapters.
 – Confirm that all components (ChapterGenerator, Logger, PromptManager) operate correctly in test mode.

Conclusion

This design precisely refactors the large pipeline prompt into two distinct chapter prompts (/chapter_1 and /chapter_2) while preserving all the exact language and details. Our technical solution includes:
 • Use of precise chapter themes and word counts: 2500 words for Customer Experience (/chapter_1) and 3000 words for Process Automation (/chapter_2).
 • Random format selection from the available templates with memory enforcement (avoiding repeats).
 • Integration of five and three ChatGPT prompts, respectively, with each prompt enhanced by a 150+ word transformational story.
 • A modular Python script (with classes Controller, ChapterGenerator, PromptManager, Logger, and TemplateSelector) that logs every step to display and a dated file.
 • A test_mode option that reduces each chapter to 100 words for rapid testing.




7. Testing Coverage  
 • A dedicated test mode is implemented so that chapters can be generated as 100-word samples, which helps in rapid iteration and debugging.  
 • The design includes unit tests for individual components such as:  
  – TemplateSelector (ensuring the previous format is not reselected)  
  – ChapterGenerator (confirming proper word count and narrative integration)  
  – PromptManager (verifying that the correct number of prompts and corresponding story details are generated)  
  – Logger (verifying both console output and log file completeness)  
 • Integration testing is also planned (by running Controller.run_pipeline()) to ensure that the end-to-end workflow fully complies with requirements and the final output meets the expected file structure and content.

1. Alignment with GOALS and Requirements  
 • The design clearly splits the single, large pipeline prompt into two chapters:  
  – /chapter_1 focuses on Customer Experience (2500 words, five ChatGPT prompts, each with a transformational story of 150+ words)  
  – /chapter_2 focuses on Process Automation (3000 words, three ChatGPT prompts, with stories featuring a Grimm-style insight)  
 • The complete prompt language is retained, with every detail—from tone and narrative style to command structure (including front/back matter and file naming)—preserved.  
 • Additionally, the system supports a “test mode” that adjusts chapter output to 100 words per chapter, ensuring rapid iterative verification.

2. Architecture Completeness  
 • The design is organized into modular, object-oriented Python classes that cover all required responsibilities:  
  – Controller: Orchestrates pipeline execution, iterates through chapter definitions, passes parameters (including tracking the previous format), and consecutively writes markdown files with the requisite “\newpage” markers.  
  – ChapterGenerator: Handles the assembly of narrative content, integrates the selected random template (using TemplateSelector), applies word count rules (full versus test mode), and embeds prompt stories.  
  – PromptManager: Parses the comprehensive pipeline prompt, generates the required prompts (five for chapter one, three for chapter two), and incorporates narrative expansions for each.  
  – Logger: Provides detailed logging of events (including template selection and chapter completion) by writing messages to both the console and a dated log file for auditability.  
  – TemplateSelector (Utility): Ensures a random, memory-enforced format selection that avoids using the same template in consecutive chapters.
 • Each component is defined with clear attributes and methods, ensuring the entire pipeline—from input parsing, through narrative validation and logging, to file output—is covered.


────────────────────────────
3. TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY  
 • The use of Python with modular classes (Controller, ChapterGenerator, PromptManager, Logger, and TemplateSelector) leverages well-known, efficient paradigms.  
 • The randomness with memory enforcement is implemented by filtering the available format list against the previous format.  
 • Test mode support (reducing chapters to 100 words) and file output with delineated page breaks (using "\newpage") add operational flexibility.  
 • The integration of detailed logging and narrative validation (maintaining tone, avoiding banned structures) further supports robust execution.

────────────────────────────
4. BREVITY and ELEGANCE  
 • Each module is scoped to a clear, single responsibility. For example, the TemplateSelector is a short, focused function that cleanly implements random selection with memory enforcement.  
 • The code examples and inline comments show minimal redundancy without sacrificing clarity.  
 • The design successfully condenses a complex set of requirements into a straightforward, efficient architecture.
