## Project Goals
This is a two chapter book pipeline.
Refactor this large prompt into two chapter ChatGPT prompts: /chapter_1 and /chapter_2
Provide a technical design to allow the Autocoder to produce a python script to execute those two chapters.
Use the exact language in the prompt. Don't lose any information.
Provide through logging in display and in a dated file.  Make the architecture testable. Allow test mode with chapters that have only 100 words each.
