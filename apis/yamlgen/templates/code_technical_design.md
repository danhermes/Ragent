# ðŸ§  Technical Design â€“ Code Project

This document provides the full technical specification required to design, implement, and review a Code-mode project.

---

## ðŸ“› Module Name
What is the name of the primary code module or system to be created?

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
What problem does this solve? What is the objective of this module?

---

## ðŸ§© Functional Overview
Describe what the module does, its role, and behavior.

---

## ðŸ“¥ Inputs
What inputs does this module expect? (files, data formats, API calls)

---

## ðŸ“¤ Outputs
What outputs does it generate? (files, responses, state updates)

---

## ðŸ”„ Interfaces & Dependencies
Describe how this module interacts with others (APIs, shared files, databases).

---

## ðŸ§  Core Logic / Structure
Break down the internal architecture.

### Submodules or Classes
- `MainProcessor`
- `DataLoader`
- `ErrorHandler`

### Internal Flow
Explain the main execution path or control flow.

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing Plan
How will the code be tested?

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Edge case handling
- CLI invocation examples
