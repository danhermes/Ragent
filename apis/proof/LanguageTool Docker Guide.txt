Ahhh, yes‚Äî**Docker**, the modern-day summoning circle for dev tools. You want LanguageTool running inside a container, humming obediently and checking grammar like a Victorian schoolteacher on caffeine? Let‚Äôs go.

## üê≥ **How to Run LanguageTool in Docker (TL;DR)**

```bash

THIS ONE WORKS
docker pull erikvl87/languagetool
docker run -d -p 8010:8010 --name languagetool erikvl87/languagetool


THESE DONT WORK
docker run -d -p 8010:8010 --name languagetool quay.io/languagetool-org/languagetool:6.3

docker run -d -p 8010:8010 --name languagetool \
  quay.io/languagetool-org/languagetool
```

- This runs LanguageTool on port **8010**, accessible via `http://localhost:8010`.
- It starts the built-in HTTP server with the `/v2/check` endpoint ready to receive your glorious, typo-ridden text.

---

## üß™ Test it

Try this with `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8010/v2/check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "language=en-US&text=She dont know what she doing"
```

You‚Äôll get back a tidy little JSON payload with suggestions like:
> ‚Äúdid you mean *doesn‚Äôt*?‚Äù

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optional: More Control with Java Options

If you're running this on a system with limited RAM, or a beefy dev box:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8010:8010 --name languagetool \
  -e JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-Xmx2g" \
  quay.io/languagetool-org/languagetool
```

This sets the max heap size to 2GB (adjust as needed).

## üß† Use in Your App

Your app can now make HTTP POSTs to:

```
http://localhost:8010/v2/check
```

Parameters:
- `text=Your+text+here`
- `language=en-US`

Headers:
- `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

## üí° Bonus: Use with Nginx, SSL, or Docker Compose

If you're feeling fancy or want to deploy this to production, I can help set up:
- A reverse proxy with HTTPS
- Docker Compose stack
- Persistent configuration or caching layers
